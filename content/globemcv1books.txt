The Prophecy of the Pit
by
blaze_it_michael



BOOK 1
Premonitions
--- Page 1 ---
It first came to me in a dream. A simple voice. A mere whisper. It told me, "The Age of the Pit is nigh." I did not listen. The whispers came to me night after night. I refused to listen. I claimed to be unworthy. But the voice persisted. 
--- Page 2 ---
Eventually I opened my ears to the voice. "WHAT?" I cried. "What do you want with a simple subject of the Baron? A simple framer, miner, or whatever my baron desires of me? 

The voice spoke:
--- Page 3 ---
"Do not fret. For you are no simple man. You are to be my prophet. You will set out on a journey and bring knowledge of me to all. You will learn the ways of all that is, and you will learn to discover all that will be."

I replied:
--- Page 4 ---
"Oh Great Mystery, I am unworthy. Please let me live my simple life. I am sure there is one more righteous in the forests of Europe or the plains of America?"

The voice replied:
--- Page 5 ---
"I have chosen you and you alone. You must go forth. But first, let me show you the world under my domain."

The Voice gave me 3 visions. 
First, he showed me a city of gold. The children smiled.
--- Page 6 ---
The men laughed and drank well. There was no need for weapons. The women remained in the kitchen and produced sandwhiches a plenty. There was a great joy.

Second, a field of zombies, spiders, and mobs of all kind was seen.
--- Page 7 ---
They howled and moaned in agony from their sinful existence. Then, a great fire appeared, wiping them all into dust. No more would they terrorize the world.

Third, there were three beasts. Each had 10 horns, and had fur coated in blood.
--- Page 8 ---
They gnashd their teeth and chased a small creature. His fur was pristine and whiter than the finest bleach. The small creature stopped dead in his tracks, and with a stare he smited the three beasts.

"Oh great voice, what shall I do for you? You have
--- Page 9 ---
shown me a world of glory and excellence beyond compare!"

the Voice replied:
"My servant, truly I tell you, your life will be forever changed. From this point on, your purpose must be to build THE PIT."
--- Page 10 ---







BOOK 2
The Creation
--- Page 11 ---
The Voice told me:
"You will build THE PIT, the sign of my presence on Earth. You will, as will all, sacrifice yourself to THE PIT and when you rise you shall be in unison with me. You will see the light I have created. 
--- Page 12 ---
THE PIT will be circular, in defiance with the order of nature. It will be 20 cubits across and deep enough to reach the columns of the Earth. You will choose five men to be your priests, and they will build THE PIT with you.
--- Page 13 ---
THE PIT will be West of the Nile and East of the Atlantic. It will be North of the Congo and South of the Sahara. All will flock to it. 

At the bottom will be my HOLY SEAL to cleanse your sould after death. It will be made
--- Page 14 ---
from purple glazed terracotta in the center. Around the cnter square, wich will be 2 cubts by 2 cubits, will be a ring of red terracotta. This will fill up THE PIT to the edge, which will be lined in quartz.  The walls will be lined with redstone torches
--- Page 15 ---
and spikes with the heads of beasts.

AT the top will be a ring of glowstone to lead weary travelers. There will be a large dome of acacia over the pit, suspended by a heigt of 7 cubits. Fince posts will hold it up.
--- Page 16 ---
There will be a platform of glass for the converts to step out onto before they are cleansed. It will be two cubits wide and 3 cubits long. The brom of the pit will be lined
with fenceposts except for the area where the platform extends.
--- Page 17 ---
Build THE PIT as I have told you. Do so in the place I have told you. Do so with the men I have told you. Go in peace and spread knowledge of the pit."
--- Page 18 ---







BOOK 3
Worship
--- Page 19 ---
Converts may ask, how will worship be done. The Voice has told me: 
"Each convert, after the cleansing, must create a small shrine. The build of the shrine does not matter, but it must contain: a copy of the Prohecies, an acacia sapling, and  the flag
--- Page 20 ---
of your nation to symbolize its unity with the Voice. 
Once the shrine is built, several laws must be observed for cleanliness. 
1) Thou shalt not eat raw meat. Starve before you sin in this way

--- Page 21 ---
2) Thou shalt not listen to the false prophets.
3) Thou shalt not drink the milk of another creature.
4) Thou shalt not rape the land which I have given you.
5)Thou shalt not cause discord and strife in your society.
--- Page 22 ---
If any of these re broken, sacrifice a cow at the shrine in your town, and all will be forgiven. The following crimes shall be known as UNFORGIVABLES:
1) Thou shalt not kill a weary traveller coming in peace,
--- Page 23 ---
2)Thou shalt not steal from your town or that of others.
3)Thou shalt not blaspheme against me or my PIT.
4)Thou shalt not pillage the farms of thy neighbor.
5)Thou shalt not question the power I possess.
--- Page 24 ---
If these rules are broken, cleanliness will be gone, and one must cleanse themself in THE PIT once again. 

There is one sin that is above all. For this sin you shall be executed in an unclean way, forever forfeiting your cleanliness.
--- Page 25 ---
The sin involves many things. One who sins n this way will likely control all world affairs, have a big nose, and evade taxes by claiming his house to be a place of worship.
j e w s.
If you are jewish, you shall die by guillotine.
--- Page 26 ---
Obey what I have told you, and be on your way."

Thus the Voice concluded his message to me, which I proclaim to you.
--- Page 27 ---







BOOK 4
PROPHECIES
--- Page 28 ---
The Voice has shown me the light. HE has told me how to become clean. He has given me a mission and I will uphold it.

After his temple was built, I received more visions. They are as follows:
--- Page 29 ---
There was a small lake. The water was clear and beautiful. Inside were millions of squids. The children gathered and harvested them. Their ink was used to create books and knwoldege aplenty. The Voice created the squids. Everything was good.
--- Page 30 ---
There was a sick man. He had become a monster. The Voice spoke into a healthy mans ear. He brewed a drink for the sick man and fed him an apple coated in excess gold. He became well. The Voice allowed this. EVerything was good.
--- Page 31 ---
There was a pit. It was deep indeed. The bodies of the faithful littered the bottom. It shone as a beacon of light through the storm. The people watched as converts entered. The Voice told them to do so, everything was good.
--- Page 32 ---
Truly I tell you, the Voice sees the world to be unclean. He has tasked me wiith cleansing it. The sins of man transcend his power on Earth, so I his humble servant shall bring about his kingdom. But first, the crimes if nations must be recognized.
--- Page 33 ---
To United States, who murders weary travellers in search of hope and oppirtunity. Truly I tell you, your people shall be the first among the judged in the time of His coming.
--- Page 34 ---
To Dogtown, who bask in their own wealth, unable to see the poor in need of help. You hoard your gold and ink and bring shame to all. Truly I tell you, in your time of need, you shall be last to receive the help you deprive others of.
--- Page 35 ---
To Empire of Brazil, who conquers free states and snuffs out their independence. Truly I tell you, as you try to unite the world under your false idolotry, The voice shall rule your empire, uniting all in a proper manner.
--- Page 36 ---
To Israel, for being a bunch of slimy Jews. Truly I tell you, all of your people shall be met with the guillotine and live for eternity in a hell like no ther due to your uncleanliness.
--- Page 37 ---
To Danubia, who tries to steak from weary travellers, taking advantage of their need for river travel. Truly I tell you, there will come a day when the river will no longer provide; only the voice will be able to.
--- Page 38 ---
To Egypt, who attempts to build so high they can hear the voices of their false gods. Truly I tell you, the only way to reach the one true God is by falling down.
--- Page 39 ---
To USSR, who seizes power from the innocent. Truly I tell you, there will come a time when the innocent shall rise, and the Voice shall support them Then, your power will have vanished.
--- Page 40 ---
To all nations who have done wrong in the Eyes of the Voice, your time will come to an end, All will come to pass, and nothing will come to follow. 

However, you are not damned indefinitely. After all, THE PIT has a purpose.
--- Page 41 ---
Truly I tell you, salvation is achievable through a cleansing. All must become one with THE PIT and thus one with the Voice. 

The Voice will save all his children, and thus all must be open.

    The book of the
            Sun
===================

Cult : Sun cult

Written by : high priest gold head



date : 28/1/2019
--- Page 1 ---
In the beginning there was nothing but darkness and cold. In this place lived the original sin of man, writhing and slithering preying on the weak pathetically, but one day a great and mighty thunderous crack rang through the world.
--- Page 2 ---
Warm and glorious light started to shine all across this cursed land purifiying all those who bathed in these amazing golden beams that made them feel loved and cared for. Some denied the Sun and instead worshipped the sky or a great kube made of weapons,
--- Page 3 ---
these people are not heretics as those who worship false beings that can die or sand or the "ocean". He who worships sand, the ocean, humans or a body of water are heretics and must be cleansed and purified with holy fire blessed by the cult of the Sun.
--- Page 4 ---
Holy fire is the only way of salvation for false believers. Cleanse their dirty being and items with blessed holy fire to teach them the error of their ways so that they might learn to worship and thank the sun for its kindness they have ignored.
--- Page 5 ---
Always keep the sun in your heart when there is darkness around you and no one seems to care for you. The sun will always be there for you showering you in its kind warm glow.

Have you ever praised         the sun?

        (DEFCON)



By President Washington

In God We Trust
--- Page 1 ---
Introduction:
DEFCON is the alert state used by the United States. It prescribes five levels of readiness or states of alertness for the US and her citizens/fighting forces.

--- Page 2 ---
It increases in severity from DEFCON 5 (being the least severe) to DEFCON 1 (being the most severe) to match a variaty of hostile situations towards the United States and her allies.
--- Page 3 ---
DEFCON 5:

This DEFCON level represents general peacetime and no action is required beyond being prepared as you would for any other situation.
--- Page 4 ---
DEFCON 4:
This level is the DEFCON level where moderate hostility towards the US has been detected.
This threats typically include but are not limited to:
-Terrorism
-Minor conflicts

In this DEFCON level a towns are required to
--- Page 5 ---
prepare for a possible conflict with another small town or individual that may pose a threat.
Towns are also required to take stricter security measures for letting random players wonder their land as well as increased intelligence gathering.
--- Page 6 ---
DEFCON 3:
This level of DEFCON is for moderate to high threats towards the United States.
These threats can include but are not limited to.
- Hostile city states
- Hostile small nations
- Individuals that pose a large, significant threat to the US and
--- Page 7 ---
her allies; as well as the world.

Course of action to take during DEFCON 3 for US citizens.
- Legally required to carry nation distributed god armor or your own armor with at least Protection 3.
--- Page 8 ---
-Legally required to carry a sharpness V weapon.
-All online must be prepared to fight within five minutes of being called.
-Must be able to follow orders from nation higher-ups at a moment's notice.
--- Page 9 ---
DEFCON 2:
This level of DEFCON is reserved for extreme level threats to the US, her allies and the world.
During this DEFCON level all prior DEFCON rules are in place and service by requirement will be enforced. Everyone in the nation must be
--- Page 10 ---
ready for conflict and WAR.
This level of DEFCON will be used against other hostile nations that pose an extreme threat. However, this may not be limited to nations.

THIS DEFCON LEVEL IS THE NEXT STEP TO TOTAL WAR.
--- Page 11 ---
DEFCON 1:

This level is reserved for when all else fails. When diplomacy hasn't worked and when total war/conflict is innevitable.

If this DEFCON level is reached then await orders from your President and congress. War is
--- Page 12 ---
either imminent or has started.

Maximum possible readiness is required for all towns.
For this DEFCON level to be reached it requires a vote including the president and 2 other appointed higher-ups of the congress.

Bruce's Log
A Tale of My Journey to the Heart of Freedom


By blaze_it_michael on his journey for God, Gold, and Glory
--- Page 1 ---
AFter a 4 day sail across the atlantic, I reached the Rio Grande. Th banks are lined with stone and lit by torches. From Here on I will record each days events.
--- Page 2 ---
Day 1
The Rio Grande has proven to be quite treacherous. It is full of rapids that sink your boat. Every 50 blocks or so I must break my boat to cross the rapids since I am going upstream. I did find a single horse swimming between the banks, so I
--- Page 3 ---
believe horses may be populous in the American south. A storm has raged on since I arrived. I have not seem any of the fearsome Americans yet, however I fear my fate if the discover me here to take resources from land, unclaimed as it may be.
--- Page 4 ---
Day 2
I just realized that the cobble on the banks of the river was a part of Trump's border wall. I had to parkour over lava to get to the other side and continue on the rio grande. God bless that man for keeping those mexi's out. 
--- Page 5 ---
The sky has cleared, and I continue now away from the border and into the heart of America. 

My first glimpse of the nation was desert, yet the open skies and free land brought tears to my eyes. Off in the distance I can see the Mesa.
--- Page 6 ---
Day 3
I have officially left the Rio Grande, and since I have seen very strange things.A mountain entirely covered with furnaces. Giant pits. Large stone structures reminding me of pyrainds. The land I had wished for appeared to be stripped , so
--- Page 7 ---
I will have to relocate.
--- Page 8 ---
Day 4
These lands are about as virgin as a cheerleader on prom night. Every fucking mine has been cleared. I have been reduced to strip mining and all I have found is 6 gold. Nonetheless I will continue my journey.
--- Page 9 ---
Day 5
The mines proved worthless here. I am returning to the surface to seek other financial oppirtunty.
--- Page 10 ---
Day 6
I have found an abandoned settlement. These people must have been very intellectual, as the have the symbol of power and civilization: a swastika. Its fucking huge, you could prob see it from space. Inside the building was an automatic farm. 
--- Page 11 ---
It looks failed, however it may be repairable. 
--- Page 12 ---
Day 7
As gold barren as the mesa has turned out to be, it's fucking wild lol. Half of the houses are abandoned. Prob got attacked by furries or some shit. Sadly no one left any gold, so I can't even rape this "virgin" land.
--- Page 13 ---
Day 8
I hve given up on my quest. There is no gold in the west. However the west is beautiful, and I am very glad I got a chance to see the wall. The American Adventure is officially over.

The Legend of Abodi

Long ago, long before the great nations of GlobeMC, there existed a man named Abodi. Abodi lived in a lush, beautiful land. A land blessed by the sun and moon alike. Abodi's days were bright and warm, and his nights were
--- Page 1 ---
nice and peaceful. He slept under the glow of the moon and awoke to the beauty of the sunrise. Abodi's lands were paradise, and he knew this very well.
Abodi was only asked by the sun and moon that he makes a yearly trip to the tallest mountain in 
--- Page 2 ---
his land to pay pilgrimage to the Sun and Moon who granted him his lavish lifestyle. He did this once a year for 5 years, but on the sixth year he decided that he would rather lounge about in the warmth of the sun. As he lay in the sunlight, he found
--- Page 3 ---
himself feeling overly warm; hot even! He began to sweat for the first time in his life. The salt from his brow fell upon the land and turned it to dust and sand. His once lavish, lush, and luxorious lands grew to become
--- Page 4 ---
dusty, dirty, and disgusting. The sun grew hotter and hotter! What misery! The nights were the opposite, as once the hot sun disappeared, the moon appeared distant and cold. The cold nights made Abodi shiver and shake.
--- Page 5 ---
Abodi made his way to the top of the mountain where he had skipped his pilgrimage. He shouted up towards the sun and moon: "Why have you forsaken me?! Why have you turned my lands to shit! Why have you made me into the  pathetic husk of
--- Page 6 ---
a man I once was?!"
The Sun replied, "You did not pay pilgrimage this year. We ask very little of you, Abodi, and give you much."
The Moon continued,   "You chose your fate when you didn't show your appreciation for all we gave you! Your children,
--- Page 7 ---
their children, and all after them will now be forsaken to live in the desolate land you have created! The ABOS, as they shall be called, will become bitter and hostile as they are born, raised, and die in the shitty lands you have forsaken
--- Page 8 ---
them to inhabit!"
The Sun shot a beam down on Abodi, destroying the mountain with him! The moon eclipsed the sun, and all of Abodi's descendants became the disgusting, ugly, sub-human ABOS that we now know them as! Non-Abos beware, 
--- Page 9 ---
for if you don't pay your pilgrimage to the sun, you too will become an Abo, and you too will suffer! Your lands will become as desolate as the lands of Australia!
ALL HAIL THE SUN

DISTILLED AND FERMENTED
-------------------An enterprising moonshiner may not understand the differences between fermented and distilled alcohols, mistakenly distilling a mead or fermenting absinthe. This section will clear up the differences between the 
--- Page 4 ---
two methods. DISTILLED alcohols are normally stronger, as they are "purified" closer to pure alcohol. Some liquors, such as Absinthe, need to be distilled multiple times. The more you distill, the stronger the drink. Distilling too much will ruin a
--- Page 5 ---
normally weaker drink. To distill, you need a BREWING STAND, which costs three cobble and a Blaze rod to craft. Put one glowstone powder into the fuel slot, as this will not consume the fuel like blaze powder. After cooking the ingredients of the alcohol
--- Page 6 ---
in a cauldron of water, use three glass bottles to obtain all the liquid from the cauldron, then head straight to your brewing stand and place the bottles in the designated slots. Each time the white bar finishes counts as a single distillation.
--- Page 7 ---
Simply allow the bar to finish for as many times as you need, then head to a wooden barrel and store the alcohol to let it age.

Now FERMENTED alcohols are much simpler to make, as they require no brewing stand! 
--- Page 8 ---
Just as before, after cooking the ingredients in a cauldron, take three glass bottles to empty the cauldron of its concotion. However, for fermented alcohols, just take the bottles straight to a barrel and let it age into a fine beer or mead.
--- Page 9 ---
WOODTYPES
-------------------For some alcohols, the difference between an average brew and a fine brew is the barrel it's aged in. In particular, the wood of the barrel. Some, but not all, alcohols require a specific type of wood barrel to be aged in
--- Page 10 ---
to craft the highest quality version of that brew. This will be detailed in the specific recipes, as not all alcohols need a certain woodtype to be a fine brew.
--- Page 11 ---
CRAFTING A BARREL
-------------------To make most alcohols, you'll need to age a brew in a BARREL to obtain the highest quality possible.
Two types of barrels exist: Small barrels, of which can hold 9 total brews, and Large, which can hold 27, 
--- Page 12 ---
but take more resources to craft.

SMALL barrels require eight (8) wooden stairs to build. Simply place two (2) wooden stairs beside each other, with the stairs facing downwards in an "r" shape. Place another set of stairs in a similar fashion
--- Page 13 ---
behind those two stairs, making a "T" shape. After this, simply make the same shape, but upside down, on the top by placing two sets of stairs on each side, facing their normal direction, an "L" shape for one side, backwards on the other.
--- Page 14 ---
After your barrel looks like a Greek cross (+) from two sides, just put a sign on any part of the barrel and write on the topmost line "Barrel" without quotations, exactly as written (case-sensitive). You should recieve a notification in the text box
--- Page 15 ---
saying "Barrel Created", which will mean your barrel is now ready for aging! If you wish to, you can now remove the sign or rename it to fit your purposes without causing error. 

Crafting a large barrel takes sixteen (16) wooden stairs, 
--- Page 16 ---
five (5) fence posts, and 18 wooden planks. First, place four (4) fence posts in a 3x4 rectangular shape, with one post at each corner. Next, place four (4) stairs connected to each other acceoss the 4 block side. From the shorter end, it should be an "r"
--- Page 17 ---
shape. After, do the same, but flipped horizontally, on the other side. Next, place 4 wooden planks in the aisle between the two sets of stairs. After this, place 10 wooden planks above the current structure in an "O" shape, be sure to two open spaces in
--- Page 18 ---
the middle of the "O" shape. Next, place 4 sets of stairs on the top in a row, making an "L" shape from the shorter side, doing the same, but horizontally flipped, on the other side with 4 more stairs. Next, fill the aisle between the stairs with 4 wooden
--- Page 19 ---
planks. Finally, attach the fifth and final fence post to the bottom middle wooden plank in the front to make a spigot. As before, add a sign and name the top line "Barrel" to get a notification in chat saying "Barrel Created".
--- Page 20 ---
COOKING WITH INGREDIENTS
-------------------The basics of brewing begin with cooking your mixture of ingredients. Different brews use different ingredients, and certain varieties of the same drink use different amounts or even extra ingredients.
--- Page 21 ---
To begin cooking, you'll need a few things. First, a CAULDRON, crafted by using seven (7) iron ingot in a "U" shape at a crafting table. Second, a bucket of water to fill the cauldron and act as a base ingredient. Third, you'll need a heat source.
--- Page 22 ---
This can be satisfied through either a bucket of lava or setting Netherrack on fire. Fourth, you'll need three glass bottles to get all the water out once you've cooked your ingredients, as a cauldron holds three bottles of liquid.
--- Page 23 ---
Fifth, you'll need a clock. This can be crafted with four gold ingots surrounding one redstone dust. Lastly, you'll need the ingredients themselves.

To begin cooking, place either lava or fire one block under where you intend on placing the
--- Page 24 ---
cauldron. Next, place the cauldron above the heat source, as this will allow the ingredients to cook into a brew. Afterwards, dump a bucket of water into the cauldron to fill it up. Next, gather your ingredients and put them into the pot by 
--- Page 25 ---
right-clicking the cauldron with the ingredient equipped. The amount of time that each brew requires to be cooked varies among brews, so you'll need a clock to accurately time your brews. To use the clock, right-click the cauldron with the clock equipped.
--- Page 26 ---
The text box should pop up a notification saying how long the cauldron has been cooking your ingredients. Keep in mind not to cook them too long, or your brew might be of a lesser quality. Once the cooking is done, simply right-click the cauldron three
--- Page 27 ---
while holding a stack of three glass bottles to obtain all the cauldron's liquid. From there, you can distill or ferment the brew by putting it through a brewing stand or a barrel, respectively.
--- Page 28 ---
AGING
-------------------
To achieve the finest quality brews, some brews need to be aged for a specific amount of time. Years aged is scaled to Minecraft days, meaning 1 Year is equal to 1 Minecraft Day, which is approximately 20 minutes in
--- Page 29 ---
real time. Although it may not apply to all brews, it is believed that aging a brew too long may decrease its quality, so be careful with how long you age your brews!
--- Page 30 ---
CLOSING THOUGHTS
-------------------
I sincerely hope you've learned everything you need to know to start your brewery in this book, and that your purchase was worth the gold. If you'd like to learn more about brewing, I suggest you purchase
--- Page 31 ---
my other book: The van der Linde Compendium of Fermented and Distilled Alcohols and Other Prepared Beverages.
I personally wish you well in your endeavors in the art of brewing.

4--Rules of Babeyish
--- Page 2 ---

--- Page 3 ---
Babeyish is a simple langauge to learn. It follows all rules and spellings of the English language, except a word is spelled one letter to the left of its English spelling. For example, 'the' would be spelled 'rgw' in Babeyish. However there are some
--- Page 4 ---
differences. Some names (especially people) are completley different than the other language (Babey [which means people or folk in English, it doesn't actually mean 'baby', a common misconception] is said as 'vilk' in Babeyish and Babeyish is said as
--- Page 5 ---
aowxh [speech]). Words with redundant letters (letter, speed nigger, etc.) are spelled with one letter, so 'nigger' would be spelled as 'bufwe', for example.
--- Page 6 ---
in proper Babeyish. Only titles or names, etc. will have capital letters, so the first letter of a sentence is lowercase. Puncuation marks do not follow the same rules as letters do in Babeyish. Sentences do not need periods unless they are followed by
--- Page 7 ---
another sentence. Hyphens do not exist in Babeyish; rather the words separated by a hyphen are the same word. Semicolons are not in Babeyish either. If a letter is at the end of the keyboard with no letter left of it (A), it will loop back to the right
--- Page 8 ---
most letter of the row (in the case of 'A', it would be 'L').
--- Page 9 ---
The rest of this book will be written in Babeyish. If you have not read the guide to reading/writing Babeyish, please do so before reading the rest of this book.

As the morning sun peeked through the pines, a bit of light found its way into a dark, damp hole. Here lay a boy - a small one, for sure, but not terribly young - who sought shelter from the world outside. Derrick, or as society would spell it Derric, was
--- Page 2 ---
in the middle of a fairly light sleep when that beam of light shone through. This was his alarm clock, so-to-speak.

In the past days I've noticed the disappearing of a few wood stocks that were in this chest.

Please, it doesn't matter that you take it, but leave a few for me. I don't like having to go somewhere to pick wood everytime I need it.
--- Page 1 ---
PD: Maybe I'm wrong, and I lost the wood without taking notice of it. In this case, ignore this :P

PDD: This apply to ALL of my objects. DONT STEAL MY STUFF.

Except cookies. Take a few cookies if you want :)

   THUS SPOKE SANS
a collection of stories     with life lessons
for everyone and for            no one
--- Page 1 ---
         1.Thebes

People say humans are social creatures.
That was not the case with SansNietzsche.
Sans wanted to make a city he would call his own,that was his goal.
He was spawned in the world,and no matter how much he worked alone he could not get
--- Page 2 ---
the gold required to create his own city.
He joined another persons town.There,he was able to trade and work with his mayor to get some money and a place to stay.He soon met FetusMuncher666 who offered him some gold to make a town,under the condition that
--- Page 3 ---
the newfounded town joins his nation.Sans accepted,packing his things,yet leaving some valuables behind for the mayor to thank him for the time.Sans traveled to the Nile,and set up a town there called Thebes.
"Trust only few people,and let it be only 
--- Page 4 ---
those who helped you that you trust.Always make sure that you help them as well,if they help you."
Thus spoke Sans.
--- Page 5 ---
     2.The Pyramid
Sans continued to expand Thebes,and decided to make a monument that will be his towns landmark.
He made a plan,a giant beautiful pyramid was under construction.
The floors were decorated with assortments of beautiful terracotta,
--- Page 6 ---
the walls were gleaming with glowstone,and the pyramid truly was a work of wonder.It seemed perfect.Sans loved it.Time passed and Sans started to get more materials.As he found more beautiful and beautiful materials,he considered changing 
--- Page 7 ---
the tip of the pyramid.The tip was usually made out of sandstone,but he felt it lacked something.
For the next few weeks he'd go on to change to 5 different materials.He finally settled for red stained glass.
He felt fulfilled,it looked perfect,for now.
--- Page 8 ---
"Even when something feels flawless and perfect,as you grow you will get and learn new things.You will see opportunities to change things,and you will have to break some to do that.Do not be afraid of such changes,for it is them that will make the work
--- Page 9 ---
truly perfect"
Thus spoke Sans.

      3.The Tower
Sans began constructing an enchanting tower.In his mind he envisioned a simple,thin,tall tower,with a cone-shaped roof.He began the construction.Once he got to the roof part,
--- Page 10 ---
Sans began reconsidering the look of the tower.He looked at all the blocks he had.He had 4 stacks of quartz given to him by heathens.This sparked an idea in Sans' mind:"I should use these blocks for the tower,to make it more unique".He used the blocks,
--- Page 11 ---
combining them with lapis,to make a big eye on the tower,to watch over Thebes.
"Create plans,have visions,but do not be afraid to change them if you find an opportunity,survival isn't about being the strongest,it's about being the one who can adapt to the
--- Page 12 ---
conditions more easily.".
Thus spoke Sans.

   4.The Departure
Sans was very happy,he was living his life to the fullest.One day,he recieved a message on Discord.It was from the very same person who helped him start his city.
--- Page 13 ---
FetusMuncher666 sent him a message.Him and Sans were on good terms for quite a while,they had fun gazing at the Mormon Hole,arguing about /s4s/ and visiting the cities.When Sans recieved the message he was shocked,for Fetus' message had said that
--- Page 14 ---
he was leaving the server.After a long conversation,Sans was soulcrushed,but he wished nothing but the best to his friend.(He wouldn't call anyone a friend though).Subsequently the nation got deleted,and Sans was left alone again,just like he wanted...
--- Page 15 ---
"When making allies,be careful to not invest yourself too much,or you will depend on them.All good times must come to an end,if you suffer,learn from it,and keep moving forwards for those who no longer do so.".
Thus spoke Sans.


--- Page 16 ---
===================Thank you for reading volume 1 of Thus spoke Sans,if you enjoy the book consider donating to Sans' city for expansion,or in ink sacs for more books.
I intend to make 4 volumes,and then I'll work on more books.

My Dear Leyf,

My elation at your words cannot be writ in a tongue so limited as our common language, as my soul weeps with glee at the mere inkling of such a thought.
--- Page 1 ---
Your azure eyes do not depart from my wandering mind, your golden locks tread my dreams with warm feelings of home. You are my hearth, you light the logs that set my heart aflame. 
--- Page 2 ---
No sea has the depth to hold my affection, as no mountain can compare to the summit of my love, as it is limitless, stretching into the vast voids of the heavens and beyond into the abstract.
--- Page 3 ---
Destroy this tome, if you see fit, or hold it close to thy bosom, hidden from prying eyes. Alas, I must hasten my words, as no courier may lay hands on this declaration, I must deliver it myself.
--- Page 4 ---
We shall meet anon, my dear Leyf.

        MEIN KRAFT







      Adolv Cubler
--- Page 1 ---
Darf ich um Ihre Aufmerksamkeit bitten
Darf ich um Ihre Aufmerksamkeit bitten
Würde der echte Slim Shady bitte aufstehen
Ich wiederhole, würde der echte Slim Shady bitte aufstehen
Wir bekommen hier ein Problem
--- Page 2 ---
Ihr alle verhaltet euch so, als ob ihr noch nie einen Weißen vorher gesehen hättet
Die Kinnladen stehen alle bis zum Boden auf
Als würden Pam und Tommy zur Tür reinplatzen
Und würde ihr den Arsch versohlen, noch schlimmer als jemals zuvor
--- Page 3 ---
Zuerst waren sie geschieden, er warf sie über die Möbel 

Es ist die Rückkehr von… - oh wart mal, kann gar nicht sein, du nimmst mich auf den Arm
Er hat doch nicht gerade das gesagt, was ich denke, oder doch?
--- Page 4 ---
Und Dr. Dre sagte… nichts, ihr Idioten, Dr. Dre ist tot. Er ist in meinem Keller eingesperrt (haha)
Feministinnen lieben Eminem, „Chicka Chicka-Chicka-Slim Shady, ich hab die Schnauze voll von ihm

--- Page 5 ---
Seht ihn euch an, wie der rumläuft, fasst sich an seinen du-weißt-schon-was
Zeigt du-weißt-schon-wem den Mittelfinger, „Ja, aber der ist doch trotzdem so süß“
Ja, vermutlich habe ich in meinem Kopf ein paar Schrauben locker.

--- Page 6 ---
Aber nicht schlimmer als das, was im Schlafzimmer eurer Eltern passiert (eh-eh-eh)
Manchmal will ich ins Fernsehen und einfach vom Leder ziehen, kann ich aber nicht
Aber es ist in Ordnung, wenn Tom Green einen toten Elch bespringt
--- Page 7 ---
Ich streck meinen Hintern deinen Lippen entgegen, mein Hintern ist auf deinen Lippen
Und wenn ich Glück habe, leckst du ihn vielleicht ein bisschen
Und das ist die Botschaft, die wir kleinen Kindern vermitteln

--- Page 8 ---
Und erwarten dann, dass sie nicht wissen, was der Kitzler einer Frau ist
Natürlich werden sie wissen, was Geschlechtsverkehr ist
Spätestens wenn sie in die vierte Klasse kommen, sie haben sie doch den Discovery Channel, oder?
--- Page 9 ---
Wir sind nur Säugetiere, naja, einige von uns sind auch Menschenfresser
Wir sind nur Säugetiere, naja, einige von uns sind auch Menschenfresser
--- Page 10 ---
Die anderen Menschen aufschneiden als wären sie Melonen
Aber wenn wir tote Tiere und Antilopen bumsen können
Dann gibt es keinen Grund dagegen, dass ein Mann
Nicht mit einem anderen Mann durchbrennen kann (ihhhh)
--- Page 11 ---
Aber wenn du wie ich fühlst, habe ich das Gegenmittel
Frauen wedelt mit euren Slips, singt den Refrain und der geht so
Ich bin Slim Shady, ja, ich bin der echte Shady
Alle anderen Slim Shadys imitieren doch nur

--- Page 12 ---
Also würde der echte Slim Shady bitte aufstehen
Bitte aufstehen, bitte aufstehen
Denn ich bin Slim Shady, ja, ich bin der echte Shady
Alle anderen Slim Shadys imitieren doch nur
Also würde der echte Slim Shady bitte aufstehen
--- Page 13 ---
Bitte aufstehen, bitte aufstehen

Will Smith muss beim Rappen nicht fluchen, um Platten zu verkaufen
Nun, ich schon, also scheiß auf ihn und auf dich scheiß ich auch
Glaubst du ich geb einen Dreck auf einen Grammy
--- Page 14 ---
Die Hälfte von euch Kritikern kann mich doch nicht mal ertragen, geschweige denn ausstehen
Aber Slim, was wäre, wenn du gewinnen würdest, das wäre doch abgefahren
Warum, damit ihr Kerle einen Grund zum Lügen habt, um mich dorthin zu lotsen
--- Page 15 ---
So, dass ihr mich neben Britney Spears setzen könnt
Scheiße, Christina Aguilera lass uns mal die Plätze tauschen
Dann kann ich neben Carson Daly sitzen und Fred Durst
Und ihnen zuhören, wie sie miteinander streiten, wem sie zuerst einen geblasen hat
--- Page 16 ---
Die kleine Schlampe hat’s mir auf MTV gezeigt
Ja, er ist süß, aber ich glaube er ist mit Kim verheiratet, hihi
Vielleicht sollte ich die Aufnahme davon mal runterladen auf MP3

--- Page 17 ---
Und der ganzen Welt zeigen, wie du Eminem eine Geschlechtskrankheit angehängt hast
Und der ganzen Welt zeigen, wie du Eminem eine Geschlechtskrankheit angehängt hast

--- Page 18 ---
Ihr ganzen kleinen Girl- und Boy-Groups kotzt mich an, ihr nervt mich einfach nur
Also wurde ich ausgesandt, um euch zu zerstören

Und von uns gibt es eine Million, die genauso sind wie ich

--- Page 19 ---
Die so fluchen wie ich, die genauso einen Scheißdreck drauf geben wie ich
Die sich so anziehen wie ich, so gehen, so reden und sich so benehmen wie ich
Könnten vielleicht das Zweitbeste sein, aber niemals genau wie ich
--- Page 20 ---
Denn ich bin Slim Shady, ja, ich bin der echte Shady
Alle anderen Slim Shadys imitieren doch nur
Also würde der echte Slim Shady bitte aufstehen
Bitte aufstehen, bitte aufstehen
--- Page 21 ---
Ich bin wie ein Kopfkino, dem man zuhören kann, denn ich geb dir nur das, worüber du dich
In deinem Wohnzimmer mit deinen Freunden lustig machst, der einzige Unterschied ist
Dass ich auch den Arsch in der Hose habe, das auszusprechen, vor euch allen
--- Page 22 ---
Und ich muss mich nicht verbiegen oder es irgendwie beschönigen
Ich geh ans Mikrofon und laß alles aus
Wenn du es auch nicht zugeben willst, ich bring die Scheiße einfach raus
Und zwar besser als neunzig Prozent aller Rapper das können

--- Page 23 ---
Und du fragst dich dann warum die Kids diese Alben verschlingen wie Valium
Schon komisch, denn wenn ich so weitermache, werde ich, wenn ich dreißig bin
Der Einzige im Altenheim sein, der noch flirtet und in die Ärsche der Schwestern kneift
--- Page 24 ---
Während ich mir mit Jergens (Body Lotion) einen runterhole
Ich wichse, aber die ganze Tüte Viagra hilft einfach nicht
In jedem von euch gibt es einen lauernden Slim Shady
Er könnte bei Burger King arbeiten, dir auf deine Zwiebelringe spucken
--- Page 25 ---
Oder auf dem Parkplatz im Kreis herumfahren, während er „mir scheißegal“ schreit
Mit den Fenstern unten und der Anlage aufgedreht
Also würde der echte Shady bitte aufstehen
Und diesen gewissen Finger an jeder Hand in die Höhe strecken
--- Page 26 ---
Und stolz darauf sein verrückt zu sein, außer Rand und Band
Und jetzt nochmal, so laut ihr könnt, wie geht‘s

--- Page 27 ---
Ich bin Slim Shady, ja, ich bin der echte Shady
Alle anderen Slim Shadys imitieren doch nur
Also würde der echte Slim Shady bitte aufstehen
Bitte aufstehen, bitte aufstehen
--- Page 28 ---
Denn ich bin Slim Shady, ja, ich bin der echte Shady
Alle anderen Slim Shadys imitieren doch nur
Also würde der echte Slim Shady bitte aufstehen
Bitte aufstehen, bitte aufstehen
--- Page 29 ---
Denn ich bin Slim Shady, ja, ich bin der echte Shady
Alle anderen Slim Shadys imitieren doch nur
Also würde der echte Slim Shady bitte aufstehen
Bitte aufstehen, bitte aufstehen

--- Page 30 ---
Denn ich bin Slim Shady, ja, ich bin der echte Shady
Alle anderen Slim Shadys imitieren doch nur
Also würde der echte Slim Shady bitte aufstehen
Bitte aufstehen, bitte aufstehen
--- Page 31 ---
Haha, glaub es gibt einen Slim Shady in uns allen
Scheiß drauf, lasst uns alle aufstehen

Germany was a newly formed nation, lead by Jarodak. Founded amongst the tall Spruce trees of Western Europe, the nation was seen to be  the first major power to inhabit the server. Other members in this power included SS44, Spape,
--- Page 2 ---
phineasor and Zachmann1. A mere few weeks after the founding of Germany, the members of Kalgoorlie joined, which originally consisted of only NaxIsHere and TheNotoriousDuck. Upon joining, NaxIsHere teleported to Bankstown, an already established town
--- Page 3 ---
with only two residents. From here, the pair walked across Australia, seeking the unmolested lands of Western Australia. This was where the town Kalgoorlie was founded. Initially, stealing and toxicity defined the settlement, earning them the nickname 
--- Page 4 ---
'Abo'. Raiding of new players and the sacking of settlements caught the attention of New_Havana - an already established superpower, at one point having the most claimed land. This hatred towards Kalgoorlie was manifested in the defence of any victims of

Today I begin my first day in the office of Dogtown as chancellor.

This morning, as I woke, I did not realize that I was chancellor. It was not until I began to explore Dogtown and came upon a room titled "Chancellor Leyf" did I realize.
--- Page 1 ---
The ferns outside grow nicely. I took the liberty of alphebatizing the library in this room. I feel safer that way.

For afternoon tea I must have added too much archerbore, for it was far too bitter for my tummy.
--- Page 2 ---
I decided to sleep under my desk tonight, but I realize now that this office must be haunted. I kept hearing scratching at the window, and howling.

I awoke before sunlight for a morning carrot. 
--- Page 3 ---
Being Chancellor is harder than I imagined, but I think that if I keep at it, things will become more simple to work through. I am excited to see what possibilities await me tomorr--

History of Mazzopolis
by
blaze_it_michael




BOOK 1
In the Begining
--- Page 1 ---
In the begining there was chaos. An endless sea of churning waters covered the Earth. No life but monsters could exist. The world was evil. The Voice came forward and spoke to the void. He commanded, "Cease your chaos! Still your waters and bring light 
--- Page 2 ---
from the darkness!" And so it was done. The waters calmed, and the voice brought forth land from the depths. He grew trees, crops, and other vegetation. The world became a lush and beautiful paradise. The Voice decided he felt lonely. So he said, "let me
--- Page 3 ---
create beings with whom I can share this experience with." So he spoke, and out of nothing came three beings. The first was Azriel. He was to be the Voice's first companion and most trusted. The second was Mithrael. He was to tend to
--- Page 4 ---
the plants that the Voice had brought forward. The third was Actophel. He was to guard the sea, and make sure it did not rise up and destroy the Voice's creation. He was the strongest of them all and  fine warrior.
--- Page 5 ---
For millenia, the Three did as they were told and kept their duties.

One day, Azriel and Mithrael walked in the fields and were talking about the Voice. Azriel was angered that his purpose was not as important as the others. Mithrael assured him that his
--- Page 6 ---
position was  the most important of all. After all, he reasoned, he was the Voice's right hand man and could learn how he creates. Azriel was not satisfied, but now full of mischief. "That is true," he said, "that I know how he creates. In fact, I bet I 
--- Page 7 ---
could replicate his ways and create my own subordinates." Mithrael warned against this, but it was too late. 
Azriel went off to create his own subordinates. The Voice came upon him and asked what he was doing. Azriel tried to hide his motives. 
--- Page 8 ---
But the Voice knew what Azriel was hiding. He asked him three times to reveal it and he refused. So the Voice raised and said, "Not onlt have you betrayed my trust, but you have lied thrice about it. Damned are you." So The Voice stretched out his hand 
--- Page 9 ---
and corrupted the image of Azriel. Deformed, he was banished into the Empty. The Voice sank to his knees an wept.

As he wept, Mithrael, outrage by his brothers banishing, rushed at the Voice from behind. Just before he reached him,
--- Page 10 ---
Actophel abandoned his post to save the Voice. He stopped Mithrael's attack, and using his great might banished him to the Realm of Fire. Though the Voice was safe, the Sea was unguarded, and terrible creatures sprang forth. 
--- Page 11 ---
The Voice grew angry. He declared, "If the evils of Chaos shall roam once more, than I shall populate the Earth with my own creations." And so he did. First cows, fish, rabbits, and other animals. Then, eventually, after he had become skilled in creation,
--- Page 12 ---
he brought about the most important of all:
Gamers.
The Voice finally rested and allowed his creations to balance out the evil. He left the world as it was.
--- Page 13 ---







BOOK 2
The Blessing
--- Page 14 ---
Millenia passed from the beginning. The three brothers lived in their realms. The Voice remained silent. At least up until this point.
The Chaos of the Ocean was beginning to gain ground on Achtophel. Gamers were becoming corrupted as a result.
--- Page 15 ---
The Voice could not let this happen to his people. So he came down to a man who was by the river, tending to his sheep. The Voice said to him, "My good sir, do you have any spare bread? I am a weary traveller in search of a meal."
--- Page 16 ---
The man looked the man over and said, "I have no spare bread in my pocket. But walk with me and sleep in my tent. Catch some rest, and I will kill a sheep and prepare a good meal for you."
The Voice smiled. He quickly grabbed the man by his head and 
--- Page 17 ---
blessed him. "Truly I tell you, my child, you shall forever be blessed. Your descendants shall share in your joy, so long as you pass this mark onto them." he summoned his power and schrched the man's hair until it became red.
--- Page 18 ---
The Voice, having established a line of worthy men, withdrew back to his realm.
The Man was called Paternus Zec. Zec begot Malachy, who begot Schmitty, who begot Adonis, who begot Friedrik, who begot brendan, who begot Bruce. Bruce was a humble farmmer.
--- Page 19 ---
He lived in a small mountain village. He had no vision of greatness in his eyes.
One day, as he was tending to is crops, two armed men approached him. They were called Gary and Matthew. They noticed the strange color of Bruce's hair. "tell me," they asked
--- Page 20 ---
"How did you inherit such a thing?"
Bruce replied, "I cannot say. It has been in my family for generations."
Gary and Matthew were learned men. They had heard legends of the blessed red headed men. They invited Bruce to come back
--- Page 21 ---
to their fortress, where they served as guardsmen for the king's nation. They wanted to find out more about the Mark of the Blessed.
Bruce agreed to join them. The fortress was not far. He stayed there for a few nights, speaking with the men and learning
--- Page 22 ---
about them. One night, as Bruce was just about to embark home, he was told that King John would be arriving. He had always wanted to meet the king so he decided to stick around. When John entered, he laid eyes on Bruce and became horrifed. He yelled, 
--- Page 23 ---
"Kill the man with the fiery hair! He is cursed!" 
His guards went to sieze him, but Gary and Matthew stepped in the way. "He is a good honest man, your grace," Matthew said. Gary pleaded to spare him, and said that any learned man would recognise the 
--- Page 24 ---
blessed mark. Still, the guards pursued. Gary and Matthew stood their ground and killed every guard. The Voice was watching over them and gave them strenth. King John was allowed to live. He ran back to his horse and quickly fled to spare his life.
--- Page 25 ---
Immediately after, Gary and Matthew had their hair mysteriously  turn red. They too had entered into the line of blessed men.  "We must hurry," Gary said. "John will return with an army soon." The three men boarded a ship in the nearby port and sailed off
--- Page 26 ---
to a far away nation in refuge.

There and Back Again
by Blaze_it_michael

My trip around the globe.
--- Page 1 ---
CHAPTER 1


THE LAND DOWN UNDER
--- Page 2 ---
I first left for Australia in an effort to find red sand for some statues. It is halfway across the world from Mazzopolis, and thus it will be long. I estimate it will take 4 days to sail.
--- Page 3 ---
Day 1
I first set off down the Vulta river. It dumps you right on the coast of Ghana, so i will still need to sail around the Horn. The choral surrounding me is lovely, more vibrant than anything i have seen.

--- Page 4 ---
Day 2
I reached the Horn and stopped in Dogtown. As there was no one online i decided to go have a look around. There are two entrances, one for visitors which leads to a large open room and another for real niggas. I travelled around the walls, and 
--- Page 5 ---
snuck in to the city through the sewage. The gimpse I have received of the city is truly wonderful. There are four becons and the biggest buildings I have ever seen.
--- Page 6 ---
Day 3 
I crossed from the cool waters of the Atlantic to the warm Indian Ocean. The water is crystal clear and much less deep. I can see the bottom clearly. 
Along the South African Coast i came across several
--- Page 7 ---
smaller colonies, independant from Dogtown. They were very cozy places, but nowhere near the likes of their neighbors. 
I have not seen any land since Madagascar. Hopefully I shall reach the land down under soon.
--- Page 8 ---
Day 4
I am halfway between Africa and Australia. No other news. I grow weary from my journey.
--- Page 9 ---
Day 5
I have reached Australia. The coast is plush and green, filled with Acacia trees. There is an abundance of sunflowers as well. On the SouthWest coast is Perth, a humble farm village. Further north is 
--- Page 10 ---
Kalgoorlie, situated  on the edge of a desert. It is a towering fortress over a pit of lava.
The red sand is magnificent. It makes the sahara seem like an ugly blemish on Mother Earth.

--- Page 4 ---
like her and death. Today I thought I killed abdul's dog, in my defense I did not know dogs can teleport to their owner. An Odd trick they can do. Today we found an abandoned town which we are deciding if we should take it over or not. We are apparently

Nordic is the native language of the nords. English speakers mainly use it for private conversations and simple codes due to its similar spelling and grammar rules to English. This book instructs and demonstrates how to write and speak Nordic.
--- Page 3 ---
Spelling is the same as English, but letters are one letter to the left (if the letter does not have a letter to the left of it, for example 'A', it will loop around to the rightmost letter in the row or 'L').
Words with two of the same letters in a row
--- Page 4 ---
will only have one ('full' for example will be spelled 'dyk').
The article 'a' is written and heard as 'o' even if the next word begins in a vowel. 'The' is 'wuh'.
Sentences do not need a period unless followed by another sentence.
--- Page 5 ---
Only names of people, places, etc. start with a capital letter, so you do not capitalize the first letter of a sentence.
If the letter 'E' is at the end of a word, it is pronounced as 'ay' of 'eh'.
--- Page 6 ---
Nouns and the adjectives describing them are one word. The adjective comes first in the word. For example, 'red car' in English is 'ewsxle' in Nordic.
'I' (in the context of referring to oneself) is 'ILK' in Nordic. 'I am' is spelled the same way.
--- Page 7 ---
Apostrophes are not used in Nordic unless it is a part of someone's name. Possessive nouns are indicated by 'X'. The letter 'X' is not used except in the previously mentioned instance.
If an English word has the letter 'C',
--- Page 8 ---
it will be translated as a 'Z'. 'Q' is not used in Nordic unless it's in an English name.
Names are spelled the exact same way in Nordic as they are in English, unless the name has a Nordic counterpart.
Names can be given in Nordic.They usually
--- Page 9 ---
have something to do with unique traits of a person.
Hyphens and semicolons are not used in Nordic.
