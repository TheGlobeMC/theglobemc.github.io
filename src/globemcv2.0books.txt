1) The UN is to be organized by the Secretary-General, who will be chosen by the member states. Secretary Generals alternate, with a new one being chosen each month. One nation can not hold the position for at least three months after holding it once.
--- Page 2 ---
2) The UN is to be comprised of equal nations. Each nation has equal voting power within the UN, one vote each. Due to the small size of the UN and the dubious nature of power structures on GlobeMC, there will be no Security Council. The UN, and whatever nations are in (cont.)
--- Page 3 ---
attendance, will decide on all matters.
--- Page 4 ---
3) Meeting places will cycle amongst the mamber nations, given that they have a meeting room to hold such a meeting. At these meetings the host will act as co-organizer with the Secretary-General.
--- Page 5 ---
4) Each nation will be represented by an ambassador and/or nation leader. Both can be present on behalf of their nation, or only one. No other nation members can be present for the meeting.
--- Page 6 ---
5) The UN will aid in ending territorial disputes, upon independent investigation into the infraction in question. The two nations involved will be able to argue their case, after investigators present the facts of the matter.
--- Page 7 ---
6) The UN will attempt to put a stop to all wars on GlobeMC, but will hold a Convention on War Crimes to determine the nature of potential wars in the regrettable event that they do occur.
--- Page 8 ---
7) The sovreign equality of all nations is to be protected. No nation has higher status or power than another within the chambers of the United Nations, regardless of membership or seniority.

      4th UN Council

Written by danithedog,
a transcription of the
4th UN Council.

January 0037


--- Page 1 ---
1. Foreign meddling in international affairs

Germany split as a result of disagreements between its members.
MJ funded the rebellion and allegedly tried convincing people in leaving the Reich, among others.

--- Page 2 ---
Discussed at the council were which measures to take.
The verdict:

The United Nations will not interfere in the political issues in Germany, and will allow the German states to settle their differences.
--- Page 3 ---
The majority, if not all of the members present, voted in favour of this legislation.

-------------------
Germany will thus be left at their own accord in resolving their issues.
-------------------
--- Page 4 ---

--- Page 5 ---
2. Josh has decided to declare Australia void, only keeping the name out of historical purposes. The nation will now be a de-facto UN neutral ground.
Sydney will serve as the UN capital, being the site of mayor UN meetings from now on.
--- Page 6 ---
This decision was agreed upon by all the nation leaders present at the meeting.


-------------------
Australia will persist, but only as a name, and not as a political entity.
-------------------
--- Page 7 ---

--- Page 8 ---
3. Ratifying the Constitution.

Nation leaders were presented with the newly-written UN Constitution, written by Josh on behalf of the UN. Nation leaders got a chance of reading it before being asked to state whether they agree.
--- Page 9 ---
Noted below are the results.

Netherlands: aye
Solaris Empire: aye
Nine Realms: aye
France: aye
Venezuela: aye
Australia: aye
Inca: aye
Brasil: aye
Nova: aye


--- Page 10 ---


-------------------
The large majority of nations was in favour of ratifying the Constitution, and thus, will be considered the official Book of Law from now on.

Yo Rubtrained2go,

I have some explaining to do regarding the Cuban Empire. How it all went down was I RTPed and was next to New Havana.  Upon arrival, I noticed I had full permissions to do whatever I wanted. On noticing this, I checked all other
--- Page 1 ---
towns in Cuba and noticed they had similar settings.  That being, I was handed the opportunity to decimate the biggest nation on the server single-handedly in one of the greates robberies the server has seen. I profited 600+ gold ingots, 200+ diamond
--- Page 2 ---
blocks, 1 beacon, 15 blaze spawners, and much more all while staying withing the rules of the server.  There are accusations that I griefed but the biggest "grief" I did was let all the sheep loose.... An act that PETA would suck me off for. I respected
--- Page 3 ---
all their builds and towns and simply took what they gave me. 

I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier. I had to keep it on the downlow and was planning on telling you later on. I understand if you dont want me in your nation anymore after this, but
--- Page 4 ---
this is some of the badass moves I like to pull. It was unpredictable, unprecedented, and undeniably the death of Cuba. 1 person who has focused on making an international hub for everyone and being peaceful destroyed a nation of 60 people
--- Page 5 ---
and 15+ towns. 

After all this you may think that I may turn on you but as a memebr of your nation I will show allegiance to you. I never cared to be allied to Cuba so I simply took it down.  As a security measure, do not make the same mistake 
--- Page 6 ---
they did. Only give perms to residents and even then keep a watchful eye over them. Nothing is stopping another robbery like this from happening and I would hate to see you as the victim of one of these. 

I will be giving you a copy of this book as well
--- Page 7 ---
as Vohki, and I will be placing another in the museum. 

Much Love,

--- Page 0 ---
In the name of Allah, the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful. [All] praise is [due] to Allah, Lord of the worlds -
The Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful,
Sovereign of the Day of Recompense. It is You we worship and You we ask for help.

--- Page 1 ---
Guide us to the straight path -
The path of those upon whom You have bestowed favor, not of those who have evoked [Your] anger or of those who are astray. Alif, Lam, Meem. 
--- Page 2 ---
This is the Book about which there is no doubt, a guidance for those conscious of Allah - Who believe in the unseen, establish prayer, and spend out of what We have provided for them,

--- Page 3 ---
And who believe in what has been revealed to you, [O Muhammad], and what was revealed before you, and of the Hereafter they are certain [in faith].
Those are upon [right] guidance from their Lord, and it is those who are the successful.
--- Page 4 ---
Indeed, those who disbelieve - it is all the same for them whether you warn them or do not warn them - they will not believe.

--- Page 5 ---
Allah has set a seal upon their hearts and upon their hearing, and over their vision is a veil. And for them is a great punishment.
And of the people are some who say, "We believe in Allah and the Last Day," but they are not believers.

--- Page 6 ---
They [think to] deceive Allah and those who believe, but they deceive not except themselves and perceive [it] not.

--- Page 7 ---
In their hearts is disease, so Allah has increased their disease; and for them is a painful punishment because they [habitually] used to lie.
And when it is said to them, "Do not cause corruption on the earth," they say, "We are but reformers."
--- Page 8 ---
Unquestionably, it is they who are the corrupters, but they perceive [it] not.

--- Page 9 ---
And when it is said to them, "Believe as the people have believed," they say, "Should we believe as the foolish have believed?" Unquestionably, it is they who are the foolish, but they know [it] not. 
--- Page 10 ---
And when they meet those who believe, they say, "We believe"; but when they are alone with their evil ones, they say, "Indeed, we are with you; we were only mockers." 
--- Page 11 ---
[But] Allah mocks them and prolongs them in their transgression [while] they wander blindly. Those are the ones who have purchased error [in exchange] for guidance, so their transaction has brought no profit, nor were they guided.
--- Page 12 ---
Their example is that of one who kindled a fire, but when it illuminated what was around him, Allah took away their light and left them in darkness [so] they could not see. Deaf, dumb and blind - so they will not return [to the right path].
--- Page 13 ---
Or [it is] like a rainstorm from the sky within which is darkness, thunder and lightning. They put their fingers in their ears against the thunderclaps in dread of death. But Allah is encompassing of the disbelievers. The lightning almost snatches-
--- Page 14 ---
away their sight. Every time it lights [the way] for them, they walk therein; but when darkness comes over them, they stand [still]. And if Allah had willed, He could have taken away their hearing and their sight.-
--- Page 15 ---
Indeed, Allah is over all things competent.
O mankind, worship your Lord, who created you and those before you, that you may become righteous - 
--- Page 16 ---
[He] who made for you the earth a bed [spread out] and the sky a ceiling and sent down from the sky, rain and brought forth thereby fruits as provision for you. So do not attribute to Allah equals while you know [that there is nothing similar to Him].
--- Page 17 ---
And if you are in doubt about what We have sent down upon Our Servant [Muhammad], then produce a surah the like thereof and call upon your witnesses other than Allah, if you should be truthful.
--- Page 18 ---
But if you do not - and you will never be able to - then fear the Fire, whose fuel is men and stones, prepared for the disbelievers. And give good tidings to those who believe and do righteous deeds that they will have gardens [in Paradise] -
--- Page 19 ---
beneath which rivers flow. Whenever they are provided with a provision of fruit therefrom, they will say, "This is what we were provided with before." And it is given to them in likeness. And they will have therein purified spouses,-
--- Page 20 ---
and they will abide therein eternally.
Indeed, Allah is not timid to present an example - that of a mosquito or what is smaller than it. And those who have believed know that it is the truth from their Lord.
--- Page 21 ---
ut as for those who disbelieve, they say, "What did Allah intend by this as an example?" He misleads many thereby and guides many thereby. And He misleads not except the defiantly disobedient,
--- Page 22 ---
Who break the covenant of Allah after contracting it and sever that which Allah has ordered to be joined and cause corruption on earth. It is those who are the losers. 
--- Page 23 ---
How can you disbelieve in Allah when you were lifeless and He brought you to life; then He will cause you to die, then He will bring you [back] to life, and then to Him you will be returned.
--- Page 24 ---
It is He who created for you all of that which is on the earth. Then He directed Himself to the heaven, [His being above all creation], and made them seven heavens, and He is Knowing of all things.
--- Page 25 ---
And [mention, O Muhammad], when your Lord said to the angels, "Indeed, I will make upon the earth a successive authority." They said, "Will You place upon it one who causes corruption therein and sheds blood, -
--- Page 26 ---
while we declare Your praise and sanctify You?" Allah said, "Indeed, I know that which you do not know." 
And He taught Adam the names - all of them. Then He showed them to the angels and said, "Inform Me of the names of these, if you are truthful."
--- Page 27 ---
They said, "Exalted are You; we have no knowledge except what You have taught us. Indeed, it is You who is the Knowing, the Wise."
--- Page 28 ---
He said, "O Adam, inform them of their names." And when he had informed them of their names, He said, "Did I not tell you that I know the unseen [aspects] of the heavens and the earth? And I know what you reveal and what you have concealed."
--- Page 29 ---
And [mention] when We said to the angels, "Prostrate before Adam"; so they prostrated, except for Iblees. He refused and was arrogant and became of the disbelievers.
--- Page 30 ---
And We said, "O Adam, dwell, you and your wife, in Paradise and eat therefrom in [ease and] abundance from wherever you will. But do not approach this tree, lest you be among the wrongdoers."
--- Page 31 ---
But Satan caused them to slip out of it and removed them from that [condition] in which they had been. And We said, "Go down, [all of you], as enemies to one another, and you will have upon the earth a place of settlement and provision for a time."
--- Page 32 ---
Then Adam received from his Lord [some] words, and He accepted his repentance. Indeed, it is He who is the Accepting of repentance, the Merciful.
--- Page 33 ---
We said, "Go down from it, all of you. And when guidance comes to you from Me, whoever follows My guidance - there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve.
--- Page 34 ---
And those who disbelieve and deny Our signs - those will be companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally."
--- Page 35 ---
O Children of Israel, remember My favor which I have bestowed upon you and fulfill My covenant [upon you] that I will fulfill your covenant [from Me], and be afraid of [only] Me.
--- Page 36 ---
And believe in what I have sent down confirming that which is [already] with you, and be not the first to disbelieve in it. And do not exchange My signs for a small price, and fear [only] Me.
--- Page 37 ---
And do not mix the truth with falsehood or conceal the truth while you know [it].
And establish prayer and give zakah and bow with those who bow [in worship and obedience]. 
--- Page 38 ---
Do you order righteousness of the people and forget yourselves while you recite the Scripture? Then will you not reason? And seek help through patience and prayer, and indeed, it is difficult except for the humbly submissive [to Allah ]
--- Page 39 ---
Who are certain that they will meet their Lord and that they will return to Him.
O Children of Israel, remember My favor that I have bestowed upon you and that I preferred you over the worlds.
--- Page 40 ---
And fear a Day when no soul will suffice for another soul at all, nor will intercession be accepted from it, nor will compensation be taken from it, nor will they be aided.
--- Page 41 ---
And [recall] when We saved your forefathers from the people of Pharaoh, who afflicted you with the worst torment, slaughtering your [newborn] sons and keeping your females alive. And in that was a great trial from your Lord.
--- Page 42 ---
And [recall] when We parted the sea for you and saved you and drowned the people of Pharaoh while you were looking on. 
--- Page 43 ---
And [recall] when We made an appointment with Moses for forty nights. Then you took [for worship] the calf after him, while you were wrongdoers. Then We forgave you after that so perhaps you would be grateful.
--- Page 44 ---
And [recall] when We gave Moses the Scripture and criterion that perhaps you would be guided.

--- Page 45 ---
And [recall] when Moses said to his people, "O my people, indeed you have wronged yourselves by your taking of the calf [for worship].
So repent to your Creator and kill yourselves.
--- Page 46 ---
That is best for [all of] you in the sight of your Creator." Then He accepted your repentance; indeed, He is the Accepting of repentance, the Merciful.
--- Page 47 ---
And [recall] when you said, "O Moses, we will never believe you until we see Allah outright"; so the thunderbolt took you while you were looking on.
Then We revived you after your death that perhaps you would be grateful.
--- Page 48 ---
And We shaded you with clouds and sent down to you manna and quails, [saying], "Eat from the good things with which We have provided you." And they wronged Us not - but they were [only] wronging themselves.
And [recall] when We said, "Enter this city and-
--- Page 49 ---
eat from it wherever you will in [ease and] abundance, and enter the gate bowing humbly and say, 'Relieve us of our burdens.' We will [then] forgive your sins for you, and We will increase the doers of good [in goodness and reward]."

The journey to
Sihrds home
--- Page 1 ---
I have reached Sihrd's home, he seems to have a friend here.
They were out to check if pigmen drop gold in the nether.
Zarathustra informed them that pigmen, in fact, do not drop gold.
I have met his friend, penut27, who just ran in with half a heart. Lucky.
--- Page 2 ---
I have informed Sihrd that he can indeed combine enchantment books for a more potent effect.
Zarathustra's help is appreciated once more.
Vision_1 joined us, appreciating my robes.
Soon Sansos teleported to me, seemingly high.
--- Page 3 ---
I wished these travelers good luck and bid them farewell.

"Testing out a theory or spending resources on something is fine, however, it is wise to ask others beforehand, as they may have more experience. This can save you time."

Journey to
Sparta
--- Page 1 ---
I have arrived to Sparta, to meet Mr_Tuttles. He had 2 friends along, and they shared their town/castle plans with Zarathustra. It makes me happy that they trust Zarathustra so much.
I was informed that they intend to clear a mountain, for the build.
--- Page 2 ---
Zarathustra took a pick to his hand and decided to help.
I have mined with these fine people for about half an hour, and it was very relaxing.
The most communicative of them was DaddyBigAndTall, whose ambitions i respect deeply.
--- Page 3 ---
"When you meet a person, always try to understand why they do things. Understanding the "Why" of a person can be the most fulfilling experience ever, as you can compare it to your "Why".I know "why" they were building the castle, and as such my "why" felt the compulsion

--- Page 2 ---
The 2 players felt bad for him and kept trying to comfort him, along with Zarathustra. The player was not comforted, and began drowning himself.
Zarathustra then killed him with his Will to Power.

"I have no time for people who do not 
--- Page 3 ---
show their will to power. They do not want to live, and Zarathustra will only help them fullfill that wish."

Cause~

Pacific Empire invaded Nothern Austrralia and established a small unclaimed outpost, nonig and King Josh had stormed them, killed them and claimed their chest of contents
--- Page 5 ---
Events after cause~

nonig and Josh had started to storm up as TRIIP has loogged in inside their base, Trip began to tp us as Sir Josh had rallied the troups in total war
--- Page 6 ---
As the people arrived, war had begun to ravish the town of Port_Moresby, as they used all their best gear, they where no match for the superior army of Australia.
--- Page 7 ---
In doing so they lost their only chance of winning, the next hour was spens with endless waves of stone axe attacks from the natives, in the process "havebadday' and her melbournite internet  crashed and she was auto killed in cobatlog X
--- Page 8 ---
The end product of this war ended in an alliance with eachother and a clear victory for Australia

Ultimatum to the Republic of Germany
--- Page 1 ---
Mr. President,

I am writing to you in good faith, as the Imperial Lands of Latvia and the Republic of Germany are allies. However, I have to believe that the nation of Germany is actively going against the treaty we signed.
--- Page 2 ---
Firstly, a German outpost was set up on the island of Hammarland, where the town of TaffelTime used to be located. I believe that this not only violates the treaty we signed, but also encroaches on Sweden. 
--- Page 3 ---
Secondly, it has been 11 days, and ut9 still has not logged on and left his land, which is east of the line we established, and violates our treaty.

If he does not log back on, he should be kicked from Germany.
--- Page 4 ---
I am giving you until Friday, November 1st, at 7:30 PM EST to fufill the requirements set in this ultimatum.


The last thing I want is conflict, or a war, however, I will not continue to fufill my promises if you refuse to fufill yours.
--- Page 5 ---
I am hoping that we can resolve this with words, rather than swords and crossbows.


Yours Truely, the Emperor of the Latvians, King of the Imperial Lands of the House of Riga, Pip

 - Endertainer
--- Page 1 ---
Those were Endertainer's last words before leaving the server for good. He sent that message to me, BananaManCan. Endertainer joined on July 18, 2019, and founded the city of Germania, formerly Germanien. Eventually Ender created the nation of Deutschland
--- Page 2 ---
, which at first only included the at that point small town Germanien. Deutschland would continue to grow, both in land and population. The second town to join Deutschland was Stuttgart, lead by Catalyst2_0, and later on Hamburg, lead by me, BananaManCan.
--- Page 3 ---
Ender would later leave the server on September 1, 2019, when he sent the message in the beginning of the book. He would then let Deutschland [unofficially] be lead by SansNietzsche, but after that, no one knows. Ender lives on here through his legacy of

building the great nation of Deutschland, and being an even better friend of his people.

The apple and pear trees were blooming
The mist floated over the river
Katyusha was walking out to the shore
To the tall, steep shore

--- Page 2 ---
She was walking out, beginning to sing
about the blue-gray eagle from the steppe
about the one, who she loved
about the one, whose letters she treasured

--- Page 3 ---
Oh, you, song, the song of the maiden
You, fly along behind the cloudless sun
And, to the soldier on the far border,
send regards from Katyusha
--- Page 4 ---
May he remember the modest girl
May he hear how she sings
May he protect his motherland
And Katyusha shall treasure their love

Katyusha was walking out to the shore

Apple trees and pear trees went into blooming,
River mists began a floating flow,
She came out and went ashore, Katyusha!
On the lofty bank, on the steeply shore.

She came out and sang she song about
Her young friend, the bluish eagle from steppe
All about the one she dearly loved,
The one whose letters she treasured and kept

Hey, a song, the song of the young girl,
Fly and go after the bright Sun,
Find a soldier on the distant borderlands
Say hello from Katya waiting long for him.

Let him remember the young and simple maiden,
Let him hear the song she now sings,
Let him protect his Motherland for sure,
And their love Katyusha will protect.

As the morning mist over the river
Fills the blooming orchards far and wide
And the trees with a morning chill still quiver,
Catherine walks out to the riverside.

--- Page 11 ---
She comes singing songs about an eagle
Soaring proudly in the sky above
And the one in the service of his people
Whom young Catherine genuinely loves.

--- Page 12 ---
May her songs fly over the valley
Rising high to ring out loud and clear.
May they follow her letters she can't tally
To that soldier on the far frontier.

He will see her standing by the water.
He will hear her songs from up above.
As he keeps vigil to protect our borders,
His sweet Catherine will preserve their love.

About her true love,

STRONKMAN, THE GUARDIAN OF THE MOUNTAIN : : : God of the Shield and Stone
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~A lonely god sits atop the peak of a mountain in the Far North. A procreation of living metals and igneous stone, his iron heart beats ever faster as he approaches

his impending doom, only to be reborn within a matter of minutes. Every death disperses his precious minerals and forms a new mountain, while his rebirth generates a dreadful earthquake, leaving behind a crater where a mountain once stood tall and proud.

In the early hours of June 28th 2019, Japan waged war on the Chinese city of cat_man_do. The Sino-Japanese war was contested by Japan, Australia and the Peace Syndicate in opposition to China. Many innocent sheep were slaughtered, and the Chinese suffered

many losses. The only death on the side of the Japanese was friendly fire between Australia and Japan, caused by a bit of chaos, started by the people of cat_man_do. The Japanese attempted to take over cat_man_do in the aftermath however the mayor refused

Ultimately, cat_man_do was liberated from the Chinese after nearly two hours of war. There is a sign, and flag on the main hill of cat_man_do proclaiming the land as the property of the Shogun. May we remember the innocent sheep genocided on that fateful

Treaty of Alliance, Non-Agression, and
Prosperity between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the lands of Ruthenia.
--- Page 1 ---
1) Borders

Ruthenia is not to expand into the Baltics or Belarus, likewise the Soviets shall not expand into Ukraine other than Rostov.
--- Page 2 ---
2) Road

A road that will connect Kiev and Riga is to be built upon the completion of Philadelphia. This will allow for goods, such as Pandas traveling by Boat, among other things, to reach Kiev
--- Page 3 ---
3) More Roads

The Polish Highway is to be finished. It was close to Kiev before being abandoned.
--- Page 4 ---
4) Non-Agression

In the event one party in this treaty is attacked, the other will either help defender her, or remain neutral.
--- Page 5 ---
Optional Merge Clause

If Ruthenia ever wishes to merge with her fellow Eastern Europeans, the Soviets would help pay 150 for the cost of making a nation. In addition, Pehps would be made a second in command. 
--- Page 6 ---
Of course, this is merely optional, and Ruthenia can activate this Article of the treaty whenever they wish.

Reflections on Leftfagging











By Peps
--- Page 1 ---
1. Preface

How is a nation deemed successful? Is it by the structures they build? Is it by the personalities that make up a nation? Or is it through a large number of towns and citizens? Many large nations have inhabited Globe, such as Utopya,
--- Page 2 ---
SPRQ, Dietschland, France, and more recently Tuscany. But can any of these nations be deemed successful? Nations like Utopya and SPRQ faded into history, being only remembered by oldfags and midfags. France, despite it's size, barely plays a role on the world's 
--- Page 3 ---
stage, and Dietschland, now dissolved back into the Netherlands and Germany, has been on a sharp decline. Out of the large influx of newfags (due to SMPearth) rose Tuscany and Whomsty_Boi. Whomsty's method of empire building, as well as the subject of 
--- Page 4 ---
our book is known as Leftfagging. The purpose of this book seeks to define Leftfagging and determine if it is a viable and legitimate strategy for building a nation primarily through examining a contemporary example, Whomsty and Tuscany.
--- Page 5 ---
2. Defining Leftfagging

Leftfagging takes it's name from Left, President of the USA who's policy of seeking out new players and immediately asking them to join him. The definition has been expanded through time though to include various other ways 
--- Page 6 ---
of begging newfags to join your nation, such as bribery and spam. In the case of Whomsty, we can refer to his method of Leftfagging as Advanced Leftfagging. Advanced Leftfagging includes core tennants of Leftfagging, but on a much larger scale. For example, begging
--- Page 7 ---
to join a nation would be on a nationwide scale, with the mayors (the few active ones at least) contantly bothering players fresh out of spawn, and bribery would extend to bribing towns to leave their nation to join the Leftfagger's nation, and spam being constant and 
--- Page 8 ---
unrelenting. One common characteristic of Leftfagging is the action is typically not recieved well by others, inspiring hate for the nation. Politely asking someone to consider joining your town/nation is not Leftfagging, but sending invites without consent and saying "JOIN [NATION]" is.
--- Page 9 ---
3. Leftfagging as a strategy

This chapter deals with the legitimacy of Leftfagging as a strategy. Of course it's a strategy to gaining more nation members, but do numbers mean anything? A typical downside of Leftfagging is that
--- Page 10 ---
throwing gold at newfags to start a town despite not knowing anything about how to run a town results in having many of your nations towns being nothing more than 1 chunk shanty towns made entirely out of cobble. In terms of nation building, which involves the construction of 
--- Page 11 ---
multiple thriving towns, Leftfagging can be considered illegitimate due to how it discourages the growth of towns in favor of numbers, which really mean nothing in the long term due to how little of an impact they make on the server overall. What is the point of having many towns if 
--- Page 12 ---
there is literally nothing in any of them. It's Minecraft, the whole point is to build, and if you don't do that and instead prioritize having a nice integer to brag about than what have you really accomplished?
--- Page 13 ---
4. Whomsty and Leftfagging

Two things can be held responsible for the size of Tuscany. 1. SMPEarth and 2. Whomsty's Leftfagging. Point 1 helps Point 2 through providing Whomsty with a steady supply of newfags to Leftfag to. As stated earlier, Whomsty has 
--- Page 14 ---
started the practice of Advance Leftfagging which got Tuscany to the size it is now. The effects of this will soon be felt, as the Towny data for all the inactive newfags will expire after 30 days, requiring Whomsty to keep Leftfagging to survive and maintain a large size. Taking a 
--- Page 15 ---
look at many of Whomsty's towns, they consist of 1-3 inactive members and nothing more than a few small structures. Even looking at the capital of Tuscany, Florence, yields nothing more than a few buildings and no infrastructure with many citizens that seem to be entirely 
--- Page 16 ---
absent on the server.
Due to Leftfagging, Whomsty has quickly become the object of a lot of the server's hatred, commonly being called a faggot due to not only his Leftfagging but also his rather annoying presence in the global chat. Tuscany at it's core is nothing more than Florence's 
--- Page 17 ---
large but empty border, many small blips on the map, and Whomsty's personality. Leftfagging has done nothing but cause problems to Tuscany, wether or not Whomsty fully realizes this. I feel it is also necessary to state that I personally have nothing against Whomsty and I have 
--- Page 18 ---
been attempting this whole time to be objective as possible.
--- Page 19 ---
5. Conclusion

The facts presented throughout this book paint a portrait of the failings of Leftfagging through its numerous negative effects and its illegitimacy as a strategy. Tuscany must keep up its strategy of Leftfagging aggressively if it 
--- Page 20 ---
wants to keep it's position on the nation list, which truthfully doesn't mean anything if a good 75% of your nation is inactive. Leftfagging has dampered Tuscany's chances for true success as a nation with the only thing possibly being able to change this being a major restructuring
--- Page 21 ---
of Whomsty's policy, but in all seriousness I doubt this will happen. I guess we'll just wait and see what happens to Tuscany.

Zwolle Dispute - 

On Nov. 27, 2019, I came on and discovered the town of "Zwolle," owned by Sihrd. Created yesterday, the town is within the natural borders of Venezuela, in Zulia State. BR_Venezuela has claim to the entirety of Venezuela's
--- Page 1 ---
natural borders. I approached Sihrd and told him about the issue, and he said he would talk to me. 420sandman came as well, speaking for Sihrd. I asked Sihrd if he could either relocate or join Venezuela, to which he said he would relocate, as he wanted to remain in
--- Page 2 ---
Dietschland. 420 denied both requests. Later in the negotiation, Sihrd switched tones and became adament on staying and remaining in Dietschland. I requested that a moratorium be put on expansion of Zwolle until negotiations were concluded, which Sihrd and 420sandman
--- Page 3 ---
refused.

This issue comes at the same time as another teritorial issue in which Arauca (now Nova_Oslo) expanded well into Venezuelan territory, against agreements made between the Bolivarian Republic and DoctorGamerXD.
--- Page 4 ---
As a long standing ally of Dietschland, and both of its constituent nations, BR_Venezuela is concerned at the expansion into its territory, and the continued threats to Venezuelan sovreignty. Agreements have been made previously between the now
--- Page 5 ---
defunct Netherlands' citizens and Venezuela on settlements. Agreements were reached on Cuba, Panama, and Puerto Rico, as the nation kindly involved Venezuela as a Caribbean nation in aiding in determining its expansion locale as to remain
--- Page 6 ---
respectful of Venezuelan claims and sovreignty.

At the same time, Dietschland is currently discussing with Venezuela the prospects of Caribbean highways, which would require the cooperation of all parties. Venezuela is potentially interested
--- Page 7 ---
in this infrastructure development.

With kind regards,

Presidente Chavez

In the name of Allah, the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful. [All] praise is [due] to Allah, Lord of the worlds -
The Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful,
Sovereign of the Day of Recompense. It is You we worship and You we ask for help.

--- Page 1 ---
Guide us to the straight path -
The path of those upon whom You have bestowed favor, not of those who have evoked [Your] anger or of those who are astray. Alif, Lam, Meem. 
--- Page 2 ---
This is the Book about which there is no doubt, a guidance for those conscious of Allah - Who believe in the unseen, establish prayer, and spend out of what We have provided for them,

--- Page 3 ---
And who believe in what has been revealed to you, [O Muhammad], and what was revealed before you, and of the Hereafter they are certain [in faith].
Those are upon [right] guidance from their Lord, and it is those who are the successful.
--- Page 4 ---
Indeed, those who disbelieve - it is all the same for them whether you warn them or do not warn them - they will not believe.

--- Page 5 ---
Allah has set a seal upon their hearts and upon their hearing, and over their vision is a veil. And for them is a great punishment.
And of the people are some who say, "We believe in Allah and the Last Day," but they are not believers.

--- Page 6 ---
They [think to] deceive Allah and those who believe, but they deceive not except themselves and perceive [it] not.

--- Page 7 ---
In their hearts is disease, so Allah has increased their disease; and for them is a painful punishment because they [habitually] used to lie.
And when it is said to them, "Do not cause corruption on the earth," they say, "We are but reformers."
--- Page 8 ---
Unquestionably, it is they who are the corrupters, but they perceive [it] not.

--- Page 9 ---
And when it is said to them, "Believe as the people have believed," they say, "Should we believe as the foolish have believed?" Unquestionably, it is they who are the foolish, but they know [it] not. 
--- Page 10 ---
And when they meet those who believe, they say, "We believe"; but when they are alone with their evil ones, they say, "Indeed, we are with you; we were only mockers." 
--- Page 11 ---
[But] Allah mocks them and prolongs them in their transgression [while] they wander blindly. Those are the ones who have purchased error [in exchange] for guidance, so their transaction has brought no profit, nor were they guided.
--- Page 12 ---
Their example is that of one who kindled a fire, but when it illuminated what was around him, Allah took away their light and left them in darkness [so] they could not see. Deaf, dumb and blind - so they will not return [to the right path].
--- Page 13 ---
Or [it is] like a rainstorm from the sky within which is darkness, thunder and lightning. They put their fingers in their ears against the thunderclaps in dread of death. But Allah is encompassing of the disbelievers. The lightning almost snatches-
--- Page 14 ---
away their sight. Every time it lights [the way] for them, they walk therein; but when darkness comes over them, they stand [still]. And if Allah had willed, He could have taken away their hearing and their sight.-
--- Page 15 ---
Indeed, Allah is over all things competent.
O mankind, worship your Lord, who created you and those before you, that you may become righteous - 
--- Page 16 ---
[He] who made for you the earth a bed [spread out] and the sky a ceiling and sent down from the sky, rain and brought forth thereby fruits as provision for you. So do not attribute to Allah equals while you know [that there is nothing similar to Him].
--- Page 17 ---
And if you are in doubt about what We have sent down upon Our Servant [Muhammad], then produce a surah the like thereof and call upon your witnesses other than Allah, if you should be truthful.
--- Page 18 ---
But if you do not - and you will never be able to - then fear the Fire, whose fuel is men and stones, prepared for the disbelievers. And give good tidings to those who believe and do righteous deeds that they will have gardens [in Paradise] -
--- Page 19 ---
beneath which rivers flow. Whenever they are provided with a provision of fruit therefrom, they will say, "This is what we were provided with before." And it is given to them in likeness. And they will have therein purified spouses,-
--- Page 20 ---
and they will abide therein eternally.
Indeed, Allah is not timid to present an example - that of a mosquito or what is smaller than it. And those who have believed know that it is the truth from their Lord.
--- Page 21 ---
ut as for those who disbelieve, they say, "What did Allah intend by this as an example?" He misleads many thereby and guides many thereby. And He misleads not except the defiantly disobedient,
--- Page 22 ---
Who break the covenant of Allah after contracting it and sever that which Allah has ordered to be joined and cause corruption on earth. It is those who are the losers. 
--- Page 23 ---
How can you disbelieve in Allah when you were lifeless and He brought you to life; then He will cause you to die, then He will bring you [back] to life, and then to Him you will be returned.
--- Page 24 ---
It is He who created for you all of that which is on the earth. Then He directed Himself to the heaven, [His being above all creation], and made them seven heavens, and He is Knowing of all things.
--- Page 25 ---
And [mention, O Muhammad], when your Lord said to the angels, "Indeed, I will make upon the earth a successive authority." They said, "Will You place upon it one who causes corruption therein and sheds blood, -
--- Page 26 ---
while we declare Your praise and sanctify You?" Allah said, "Indeed, I know that which you do not know." 
And He taught Adam the names - all of them. Then He showed them to the angels and said, "Inform Me of the names of these, if you are truthful."
--- Page 27 ---
They said, "Exalted are You; we have no knowledge except what You have taught us. Indeed, it is You who is the Knowing, the Wise."
--- Page 28 ---
He said, "O Adam, inform them of their names." And when he had informed them of their names, He said, "Did I not tell you that I know the unseen [aspects] of the heavens and the earth? And I know what you reveal and what you have concealed."
--- Page 29 ---
And [mention] when We said to the angels, "Prostrate before Adam"; so they prostrated, except for Iblees. He refused and was arrogant and became of the disbelievers.
--- Page 30 ---
And We said, "O Adam, dwell, you and your wife, in Paradise and eat therefrom in [ease and] abundance from wherever you will. But do not approach this tree, lest you be among the wrongdoers."
--- Page 31 ---
But Satan caused them to slip out of it and removed them from that [condition] in which they had been. And We said, "Go down, [all of you], as enemies to one another, and you will have upon the earth a place of settlement and provision for a time."
--- Page 32 ---
Then Adam received from his Lord [some] words, and He accepted his repentance. Indeed, it is He who is the Accepting of repentance, the Merciful.
--- Page 33 ---
We said, "Go down from it, all of you. And when guidance comes to you from Me, whoever follows My guidance - there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve.
--- Page 34 ---
And those who disbelieve and deny Our signs - those will be companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally."
--- Page 35 ---
O Children of Israel, remember My favor which I have bestowed upon you and fulfill My covenant [upon you] that I will fulfill your covenant [from Me], and be afraid of [only] Me.
--- Page 36 ---
And believe in what I have sent down confirming that which is [already] with you, and be not the first to disbelieve in it. And do not exchange My signs for a small price, and fear [only] Me.
--- Page 37 ---
And do not mix the truth with falsehood or conceal the truth while you know [it].
And establish prayer and give zakah and bow with those who bow [in worship and obedience]. 
--- Page 38 ---
Do you order righteousness of the people and forget yourselves while you recite the Scripture? Then will you not reason? And seek help through patience and prayer, and indeed, it is difficult except for the humbly submissive [to Allah ]
--- Page 39 ---
Who are certain that they will meet their Lord and that they will return to Him.
O Children of Israel, remember My favor that I have bestowed upon you and that I preferred you over the worlds.
--- Page 40 ---
And fear a Day when no soul will suffice for another soul at all, nor will intercession be accepted from it, nor will compensation be taken from it, nor will they be aided.
--- Page 41 ---
And [recall] when We saved your forefathers from the people of Pharaoh, who afflicted you with the worst torment, slaughtering your [newborn] sons and keeping your females alive. And in that was a great trial from your Lord.
--- Page 42 ---
And [recall] when We parted the sea for you and saved you and drowned the people of Pharaoh while you were looking on. 
--- Page 43 ---
And [recall] when We made an appointment with Moses for forty nights. Then you took [for worship] the calf after him, while you were wrongdoers. Then We forgave you after that so perhaps you would be grateful.
--- Page 44 ---
And [recall] when We gave Moses the Scripture and criterion that perhaps you would be guided.

--- Page 45 ---
And [recall] when Moses said to his people, "O my people, indeed you have wronged yourselves by your taking of the calf [for worship].
So repent to your Creator and kill yourselves.
--- Page 46 ---
That is best for [all of] you in the sight of your Creator." Then He accepted your repentance; indeed, He is the Accepting of repentance, the Merciful.
--- Page 47 ---
And [recall] when you said, "O Moses, we will never believe you until we see Allah outright"; so the thunderbolt took you while you were looking on.
Then We revived you after your death that perhaps you would be grateful.
--- Page 48 ---
And We shaded you with clouds and sent down to you manna and quails, [saying], "Eat from the good things with which We have provided you." And they wronged Us not - but they were [only] wronging themselves.
And [recall] when We said, "Enter this city and-
--- Page 49 ---
eat from it wherever you will in [ease and] abundance, and enter the gate bowing humbly and say, 'Relieve us of our burdens.' We will [then] forgive your sins for you, and We will increase the doers of good [in goodness and reward]."

I never really knew you when I first joined, and almost every time I tried to be your ally you declined. You also never really talked to me besides asking for me to shop for gold. Thank you for not being a cuck like some other people have been

I also remember when you had first started, and from building in Jersey to building the shittiest New York City ever, I stuck with you. I did NOT stick with you when you let those Albanite cucks into
--- Page 7 ---
your nation. But through the majority I have never really been against you. Thanks for being my ally and a good neighbor through all of our time together.

Holstein,

You started off a French colony and then became the
--- Page 8 ---
closest town to mine. You've really grown with me here, especially with the formation of the American Republic. Even if you once declared my United States was fake, you have still been one hell of a good friend. Thank you for being the only person on the 
--- Page 9 ---
server for joining my nation that I do not know in real life.

Bob,

I wish you could read this in minecraft, but thanks for being you. You always made Unauntian and I laugh whenever we played. You always were
--- Page 10 ---
alive or something. You'll never get to experience your dream of a new reset. But I'll really miss you Bob.

Pikacraft,

I don't really know you all that well, but thanks for being in EST gang and for forming one of my
--- Page 11 ---
favorite European countries.

Nico,

I don't really know you either, but you were Bob's good friend so you're also mine, even if you do call me gay for living in the United States.

Cuckberg I
Twas the year 2018, in the town of O'ahu when a man, by the name of Pickle arrived. With the arrival of Pickle many of the natives were caught off guard, as outsiders were rare, and hard to come across. A woman named Platehead then drew close
--- Page 1 ---
Cuckberg I
When Platehead drew close, Pickle was drawn aback, as he was stunned by her beauty. However, know to all but the newcomer, Platehead was a wench, and offered herself to all those with adequite coin.
--- Page 2 ---
Cuckberg I
After a meeting of intimacy Platehead bore Pickle's seed, as unprotected sex was utelized in a reckless manner. The man who sold the body of Platehead went by the name of McLovin, this man then proceded to test the might of the one who lay seed
--- Page 3 ---
Cuckberg I
Pickle stayed the trials of McLovin, and smote him with ease, freeing Platehead in the process. Platehead wished to live with the newcomer, yet Pickle refused and Platehead was cast out to the isle of Lana'i.
--- Page 4 ---
Cuckberg I
On this isle of Lana'i the holy wench gave birth to her son. This son was then dubbed Sea, by the surrounding climate. This boy then, upon being told of his pas, returned to the town of O'ahu.
--- Page 5 ---
Cuckberg II
Sea, at the age of 2 years finished his journey back to O'ahu, his true birth town. Upon his return, he visited the local inn. This inn was place to know ruffians and mobsters, he was approached by a man named Cutter, and was recruited.
--- Page 6 ---
Cuckberg II
This Cutter fellow was followed by another, named Crippler. These men introduced the 2 year old Sea to their assasination organization named Shadow Squadron. This battalion of men carried out many executions and assassinations.
--- Page 7 ---
Cuckberg II
By the time that Sea carried out his fifth assasination he grew to the age of 5. However on his 6th mission, he was tasked to assassinate a senator for a local town. This mission led him back to his past, one clouded in mystery.
--- Page 8 ---
Cuckberg II
On this assassination mission Sea encountered another gang, however this one for a noble, righteous cause. The alliance of 104, was a well known group, renouwned for their smooth tongues and precision attacks was led by Sea's father, Pickle.
--- Page 9 ---
Cuckberg II
Sea was tasked with assassinating the man in which the Alliance of 104 was talking to. Upon carring out his task Sea fled, avoiding his father's gaze. This led Sea to feel regret and remourse for his killings, at the age of 5.
--- Page 10 ---
Cuckberg III
Upon the disbanding of the nefarious Shadow Squadron the leader 'disappeared' and his right hand man Crippler was left a broken and bitter man. Sea however, moved on to find his father and join the Alliance of 104.
--- Page 11 ---
Cuckberg III
Upon regrouping with his father, Pickle, Sea advanced quickly, and within the matter of 2 months he grew to the age of 16. Sadly, after this time his father Pickle died, and after much remourse a dastardly man took the leading role.
--- Page 12 ---
Cuckberg III
This man, however dastardly he was, promoted Sea to a high up position in the Alliance of 104. Sea, upon realizing his situation fled the Alliance of 104, and returned to his home in O'ahu. Where he then aged 80 years over 1 day.
--- Page 13 ---
Cuckberg III
Sea's final act was to plant his 97 year old penis into the dirt in which he lay, founding the town now known as Pearl_Harbor.
--- Page 14 ---
Tardex I
One who fights another brother is that of scum and villanry. Those men are truly cucks and fucks, not worthy of  a single drop of cum.
--- Page 15 ---
Tardex II
Those who decide to denounce the name of the holy island of O'ahu are similar in their villanry as they turn their backs on the true land of grace
--- Page 16 ---
Tardex III
When those involved in the great beyond order of TW face away from their brothers and join alliances beyond what is true and just they must be shown the error of their ways and converted to true justice

Hey Parker. It's steve, or Leo if you wanna call me that. I just wanted to let you know that I'm leaving the server and probably not coming back any time soon. The reason is because Cody, the server administrator, banned several Utopyans including Sans.
--- Page 1 ---
He banned them for "griefing" TheKingPE's base. They only knocked out one stupid wall, which was probably like 15 blocks so it was not anything to be banned over. Sans asked why they were banned, and then Cody banned Sans for asking why they were banned.
--- Page 2 ---
This whole situation is totally retarded. Me and some other Utopyans are starting a new server without all this garbage administration that we get here on GlobeMC. If you want to join it, or just want to say hey, message me on Discord.
--- Page 3 ---
I'm leotheturtle#4438, send me a friend request or something, alright? Hopefully I'll see you around, man. If I don't, I hope you live a good life and I hope you had a good time here. Thanks for being such a cool guy.

The Alleged Arts. In Alleged Lands, made by an Alleged Person.

Nobody knows if this person exists or not, because he is alleged. You cannot assume for sure that this person was even a person, or if he thought up The Alleged Arts.

The only thing we
--- Page 1 ---
can be sure of is that everything must be Alleged. Nothing more, Nothing less.

As all things should be, I am also Alleged. This book might not even exist, as it is Alleged. Maybe I do not exist.

Maybe I both exist and do not exist.
--- Page 2 ---
I cannot be sure of that, however, as I am alleged.

You, the reader, who might not even be reading this book, are too, Alleged.

Nobody can be sure if Hitler was correct or not, as he and his ideas were also Alleged.
--- Page 3 ---
That might be something worth talking about for the duration of this book.

Was Hitler actually correct? Are the Jews really that bad?

This is my struggle.

Mein Kampf.
--- Page 4 ---
Behold, for the true purpose of this book has been revealed.

The Greatest Story Never Told.

Young Adolf lived a hard childhood. When his 15 Year Old Brother ran away, he was left to do most of the chores.
--- Page 5 ---
Adolf was an interesting person.

So interesting in fact, that one day, for no particular reason at all, people voted Hitler into power. And in 1933, he put the Enabling Act into place, giving him awesome power, only to be held by few who were worthy.
--- Page 6 ---
It's Post WW2. People were starting to doubt Hitler long before this time period however, and for good reason.

He genocided an entire race of people! How could anyone think this madman could be right about anything?

But alas, these were lies.
--- Page 7 ---
It honeslty seemed way more plausible that the Jews in camps died from a War Torn Germany that suffered from allied bombings of railroads, preventing food and supplies to the starving Jewish Population.

But the Jews today, however, want to tell
--- Page 8 ---
a different story. They want you to believe that Hitler was attempting to genocide the entirety of the Jewish Population, rather then detain and deport them.

A people so few, but so powerful, was able to trick the entire world.
--- Page 9 ---
THE JUDES.

the judes.

The next time somebody calls you Anti-Semetic, maybe you should give them this book.

Well, as I was kicked for idleing for more than 15 minutes, and all my progress was undone, I am fucking tilted.
Cody, if you ever read this, re-configure your server so that people who write a book aren't kicked for idleing, fucking hell.
--- Page 1 ---
Alright, secondly, Cody, drop your drug habbit, it's bad for you and deteriorates your health and - ultimately - your life.
The server was overall very nice, the people were more or less friendly (besides some bad apples, I am looking at you, Vohki)
--- Page 2 ---
Side-note: if you ever meet Vohki in a pvp area, kill his faggot ass, he deserves more than a good spanking.
Sans, thanks for helping me out at times, you were good.
Doc, I thought you were a faggot at the start, but you turned out pretty alright, thanks!
--- Page 3 ---
Nico, you might've been very nice to me, but you still have a cocky attitude, I dislike that about people, drop that :) or don't, your choice
Andrey, good luck on uniting Germany, be good to BananaManCan, he is a bro!
Btw, Sans, if BananaManCan ever needs
--- Page 4 ---
help, help him, please :)

Well, this is everything, I think. The time on this server was very enjoyable, so thanks for that, I guess, Cody.
My bro and I appreciated it
I wish you all the most fun on this beautiful crafted server!

The next part will be completely in German, which means only German people, or those who bother to type everything into a translator will be able to read it. (Yes, I mean you, Sans)
Well, the server was all right, sadly the real world and real life is 
--- Page 1 ---
calling. I am desperately hoping that my studies will be more than successful.
And,Sans,I'll keep my fingers crossed that you learn everything you're up to in life!
BananaManCan, please do not be mad that I'm not on the server anymore. I gave you resident
--- Page 2 ---
status in Germania, so you can access it anytime.(Translators note: I assume this means permissions.)
Please do not destroy anything!
Thats it from me, thanks for reading.
I wish you all the greatest fun in this world,farewell!

Yo Rubtrained2go,

I have some explaining to do regarding the Cuban Empire. How it all went down was I RTPed and was next to New Havana.  Upon arrival, I noticed I had full permissions to do whatever I wanted. On noticing this, I checked all other
--- Page 1 ---
towns in Cuba and noticed they had similar settings.  That being, I was handed the opportunity to decimate the biggest nation on the server single-handedly in one of the greates robberies the server has seen. I profited 600+ gold ingots, 200+ diamond
--- Page 2 ---
blocks, 1 beacon, 15 blaze spawners, and much more all while staying withing the rules of the server.  There are accusations that I griefed but the biggest "grief" I did was let all the sheep loose.... An act that PETA would suck me off for. I respected
--- Page 3 ---
all their builds and towns and simply took what they gave me. 

I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier. I had to keep it on the downlow and was planning on telling you later on. I understand if you dont want me in your nation anymore after this, but
--- Page 4 ---
this is some of the badass moves I like to pull. It was unpredictable, unprecedented, and undeniably the death of Cuba. 1 person who has focused on making an international hub for everyone and being peaceful destroyed a nation of 60 people
--- Page 5 ---
and 15+ towns. 

After all this you may think that I may turn on you but as a memebr of your nation I will show allegiance to you. I never cared to be allied to Cuba so I simply took it down.  As a security measure, do not make the same mistake 
--- Page 6 ---
they did. Only give perms to residents and even then keep a watchful eye over them. Nothing is stopping another robbery like this from happening and I would hate to see you as the victim of one of these. 

I will be giving you a copy of this book as well
--- Page 7 ---
as Vohki, and I will be placing another in the museum. 

Much Love,
Trackpadhero69

    The book of the
            Sun
===================

Cult : Sun cult

Written by : high priest gold head



date : 28/1/2019
--- Page 1 ---
In the beginning there was nothing but darkness and cold. In this place lived the original sin of man, writhing and slithering preying on the weak pathetically, but one day a great and mighty thunderous crack rang through the world.
--- Page 2 ---
Warm and glorious light started to shine all across this cursed land purifiying all those who bathed in these amazing golden beams that made them feel loved and cared for. Some denied the Sun and instead worshipped the sky or a great kube made of weapons,
--- Page 3 ---
these people are not heretics as those who worship false beings that can die or sand or the "ocean". He who worships sand, the ocean, humans or a body of water are heretics and must be cleansed and purified with holy fire blessed by the cult of the Sun.
--- Page 4 ---
Holy fire is the only way of salvation for false believers. Cleanse their dirty being and items with blessed holy fire to teach them the error of their ways so that they might learn to worship and thank the sun for its kindness they have ignored.
--- Page 5 ---
Always keep the sun in your heart when there is darkness around you and no one seems to care for you. The sun will always be there for you showering you in its kind warm glow.

Have you ever praised         the sun?

--- Page 0 ---





   THUS SPOKE SANS
a collection of stories     with life lessons
for everyone and for            no one
--- Page 1 ---
         1.Thebes

People say humans are social creatures.
That was not the case with SansNietzsche.
Sans wanted to make a city he would call his own,that was his goal.
He was spawned in the world,and no matter how much he worked alone he could not get
--- Page 2 ---
the gold required to create his own city.
He joined another persons town.There,he was able to trade and work with his mayor to get some money and a place to stay.He soon met FetusMuncher666 who offered him some gold to make a town,under the condition that
--- Page 3 ---
the newfounded town joins his nation.Sans accepted,packing his things,yet leaving some valuables behind for the mayor to thank him for the time.Sans traveled to the Nile,and set up a town there called Thebes.
"Trust only few people,and let it be only 
--- Page 4 ---
those who helped you that you trust.Always make sure that you help them as well,if they help you."
Thus spoke Sans.
--- Page 5 ---
     2.The Pyramid
Sans continued to expand Thebes,and decided to make a monument that will be his towns landmark.
He made a plan,a giant beautiful pyramid was under construction.
The floors were decorated with assortments of beautiful terracotta,
--- Page 6 ---
the walls were gleaming with glowstone,and the pyramid truly was a work of wonder.It seemed perfect.Sans loved it.Time passed and Sans started to get more materials.As he found more beautiful and beautiful materials,he considered changing 
--- Page 7 ---
the tip of the pyramid.The tip was usually made out of sandstone,but he felt it lacked something.
For the next few weeks he'd go on to change to 5 different materials.He finally settled for red stained glass.
He felt fulfilled,it looked perfect,for now.
--- Page 8 ---
"Even when something feels flawless and perfect,as you grow you will get and learn new things.You will see opportunities to change things,and you will have to break some to do that.Do not be afraid of such changes,for it is them that will make the work
--- Page 9 ---
truly perfect"
Thus spoke Sans.

      3.The Tower
Sans began constructing an enchanting tower.In his mind he envisioned a simple,thin,tall tower,with a cone-shaped roof.He began the construction.Once he got to the roof part,
--- Page 10 ---
Sans began reconsidering the look of the tower.He looked at all the blocks he had.He had 4 stacks of quartz given to him by heathens.This sparked an idea in Sans' mind:"I should use these blocks for the tower,to make it more unique".He used the blocks,
--- Page 11 ---
combining them with lapis,to make a big eye on the tower,to watch over Thebes.
"Create plans,have visions,but do not be afraid to change them if you find an opportunity,survival isn't about being the strongest,it's about being the one who can adapt to the
--- Page 12 ---
conditions more easily.".
Thus spoke Sans.

   4.The Departure
Sans was very happy,he was living his life to the fullest.One day,he recieved a message on Discord.It was from the very same person who helped him start his city.
--- Page 13 ---
FetusMuncher666 sent him a message.Him and Sans were on good terms for quite a while,they had fun gazing at the Mormon Hole,arguing about /s4s/ and visiting the cities.When Sans recieved the message he was shocked,for Fetus' message had said that
--- Page 14 ---
he was leaving the server.After a long conversation,Sans was soulcrushed,but he wished nothing but the best to his friend.(He wouldn't call anyone a friend though).Subsequently the nation got deleted,and Sans was left alone again,just like he wanted...
--- Page 15 ---
"When making allies,be careful to not invest yourself too much,or you will depend on them.All good times must come to an end,if you suffer,learn from it,and keep moving forwards for those who no longer do so.".
Thus spoke Sans.


--- Page 16 ---
===================Thank you for reading volume 1 of Thus spoke Sans,if you enjoy the book consider donating to Sans' city for expansion,or in ink sacs for more books.
I intend to make 4 volumes,and then I'll work on more books.

Hi,

Congratulations! If you have received this book, as well as a plot of land in Chile, then you have been identified as an exceptional builder. *clap clap* This means that you have the freedom to build any structure of your choosing within 
--- Page 1 ---
guidelines set by Track and the Chilean Building Society {also, Track} in the business district of Chile. So let's set some guidelines and goals of what you can build.

Purpose: The purpose of your building can be whatever you want. Do you want a Sex Shack? Go for it! Do 
--- Page 2 ---
you want a rival shop to compete against Chile's products? Dick move, but sure. Do you want a gigantic church devoted to worshipping a pickle? By all means build it.
This build, although in Chile, will be attached to your name and town so do with it as you please.

--- Page 3 ---
Style: I would like to keep the style of builds as business-y as possible. As we are in a skyscraper area, build something that you may see in a city. This does not have to be a tall skyscraper but just something that would appear in an industrialized city. It can be any block style of your 
--- Page 4 ---
choosing but please refrain from using outlandish block selections.  Again, you were chosen because you are an exceptional builder (and sexy ;) ) so build like you would in your town.

Plots: As of now, I'm sectioning off 1 plot 

--- Page 5 ---
to each builder. However, there are some plots that fall between two plots so just try to stick to the general area i laid out. If you go over thats okay but just ask Track if its more than one or two blocks. Additionally, if you would like another plot, the cost is 42
--- Page 6 ---
gold per bonus plot.  The reason for this is that I'm essentially giving you free real estate in Chile in exchange for a nice build so i cant just give free plots willy nilly plus I'd like to get variation on builders. 

Guidelines & Limitations:
--- Page 7 ---
1. Have Fun
2. Build something that you genuinely enjoy
3. Please dont build anything like weiner buildings or nazi flag buildings (i dont want to have to evict you but i will if you build like this)
4. Please dont build onto the street. You may build overhangs that creep over but 
--- Page 8 ---
the road and sidewalks are off limits to building foundations (allow players to walk and jump on the sidewalks but your build can creep over if this is met)
5. Please allow one block of space between your build and the next plot(s).
 
--- Page 9 ---
This may restrict your land but it makes it so we dont have a block of buildings and players can walk through builds. Again, things like roofs (roofs? rooves?) can creep over.
6. Dont build anything higher than 130 blocks, if youre within a couple blocks thats fine but anything
--- Page 10 ---
more than 10 talk to Track.
7. If you have to terraform go for it but keep it minimal. If you are building on a hill feel free to flatten it out but keep the hill's shape around it.
8. I realize i have perms to be able to build/break/switch on your embassy plot.
--- Page 11 ---
However, i will not exercise thoser permissions.  If you catch me stealing from your embassy plot in chile, this book can serve as me saying that Cody can ban me if i do.

Thank you for building in Chile! I hope you have fun and I hope your building serves
--- Page 12 ---
the purpose you were trying to accomplish. I would like to make Chile a big area people meet and congregate and am planning on moving my spawn to this area. This being, if Chile explodes in popularity, these claims will essentially be gold mines. I am not giving out anymore free 
--- Page 13 ---
plots other than these so, if chile gets more popular than it is now, these would be busy plots that you got for free. 

If at any point you decide to stop building please let Track know so there isn't a half built structure in Chile for like months. I won't evict you for taking
--- Page 14 ---
a while to build but realistically if you lose interest just tell me. Again thank you for building in Chile and have fun!

Dubai (/duːˈbaɪ/ doo-BY; Arabic: دبي‎ Dubay, Gulf Arabic: Arabic pronunciation: [dʊˈbɑj]) is the largest  and most populous city in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). On the southeast coast of the Persian  Gulf, it is the capital of the Emirate of Dubai, one
--- Page 1 ---
of the seven emirates that make up the country.
Dubai is a global city and business hub of the Middle East. It is also a major global transport hub for passengers and cargo. Oil revenue helped accelerate the development of the city, which was already a 

--- Page 2 ---
major mercantile hub, but Dubai's oil reserves are limited and production levels are low: today, less than 5% of the emirate's revenue comes from oil.
A growing centre for regional and international trade since the early 20th century, Dubai's economy 
--- Page 3 ---
today relies on revenues from trade, tourism, aviation, real estate, and financial services.
Dubai has attracted world attention through large construction projects and sports events, in particular the world's tallest building,  the Burj Khalifa. As of 
--- Page 4 ---
2012, Dubai was the most expensive city in the Middle East. In 2014, Dubai's hotel rooms were rated as the second most expensive in the world.

--- Page 5 ---
Etymology:
Many theories have been proposed as to the origin of the word "Dubai". One theory suggests the word was used to describe the souq, which was similar to the souq in Ba. An Arabic proverb says "Daba Dubai" (Arabic: دبا دبي‎), 
--- Page 6 ---
 meaning "They came with a lot of money." According to Fedel Handhal, a scholar on the UAE's history and culture, the word Dubai may have come from the word daba (Arabic: دبا‎) (a past tense derivative of yadub (Arabic: يدب‎), which means "to creep"),
--- Page 7 ---
 referring to the slow flow of Dubai Creek inland. The poet and scholar Ahmad Mohammad Obaid traces it to the same word, but to its alternative meaning of "baby locust" (Arabic: جراد‎) due to the abundant nature of locusts in the area before settlement. 
--- Page 8 ---
History:
The history of human settlement in the area now defined by the United Arab Emirates is rich and complex, and points to extensive trading links between the civilizations of the Indus Valley and Mesopotamia, but also as far afield as the Levant.
--- Page 9 ---
 Archaeological finds in the emirate of Dubai, particularly at Al-Ashoosh, Al Sufouh and the notably rich trove from Saruq Al Hadid show settlement through the Ubaid and Hafit periods,  the Umm Al Nar and Wadi Suq periods  and the three Iron ages in the 
--- Page 10 ---
UAE. The area was covered with sand about 5,000 years ago as the coast retreated inland, becoming part of the city's present coastline. Pre-Islamic ceramics have been found from the 3rd and 4th centuries. 
 Prior to the introduction of Islam to the area, 
--- Page 11 ---
 the people in this region worshiped Bajir (or Bajar). After the spread of Islam in the region, the Umayyad Caliph of the eastern Islamic world invaded south-east Arabia and drove out the Sassanians. Excavations by the Dubai Museum in the region of 
--- Page 12 ---
Al-Jumayra (Jumeirah) found several artefacts from the Umayyad period. The earliest recorded mention of Dubai is in 1095 in the Book of Geography by the Andalusian-Arab geographer Abu Abdullah al-Bakri. the Venetian pearl merchant Gasparo Balbi 
--- Page 13 ---
 visited the area in 1580 and mentioned Dubai (Dibei) for its pearling industry. 

Establishment of modern Dubai:
Dubai is thought to have been established as a fishing village in the early 18th century and was, 
--- Page 14 ---
by 1822, a town of some 700–800 members of the Bani Yas tribe and subject to the rule of Sheikh Tahnun bin Shakhbut of Abu Dhabi.
In 1833, following tribal feuding, members of the Al Bu Falasah tribe seceded from Abu Dhabi and established themselves
--- Page 15 ---
in Dubai. The exodus from Abu Dhabi was led by Obeid bin Saeed and Maktoum bin Butti, who became joint leaders of Dubai until Ubaid died in 1836, leaving Maktum to establish the Maktoum dynasty. Dubai signed the General Maritime Treaty of 1820 along 
--- Page 16 ---
with other Trucial States, following the British punitive expedition against Ras Al Khaimah of 1819, which also led to the bombardment of the coastal communities of the Persian Gulf. This led to the 1853 Perpetual Maritime Truce.

--- Page 17 ---
 Dubai also – like its neighbours on the Trucial Coast – entered into an exclusivity agreement in which the United Kingdom took responsibility for the emirate's security in 1892. In 1841, a smallpox epidemic broke out in the Bur Dubai locality, 
--- Page 18 ---
forcing residents to relocate east to Deira. In 1896, fire broke out in Dubai, a disastrous occurrence in a town where many family homes were still constructed from barasti - palm fronds. The conflagration consumed half the houses of Bur Dubai,
--- Page 19 ---
 while the district of Deira was said to have been totally destroyed. The following year, more fires broke out. A female slave was caught in the act of starting one such blaze and was subsequently put to death. In 1901, Maktoum bin Hasher Al Maktoum
--- Page 20 ---
 established Dubai as a free port with no taxation on imports or exports and also gave merchants parcels of land and guarantees of protection and tolerance. These policies saw a movement of merchants not only directly from Lingeh,

--- Page 21 ---
 but also those who had settled in Ras Al Khaimah and Sharjah (which had historical links with Lingeh through the Al Qawasim tribe) to Dubai. An indicator of the growing importance of the port of Dubai can be gained from the movements of steamer of the

--- Page 22 ---
Bombay and Persia Steam Navigation Company, which from 1899 to 1901 paid five visits annually to Dubai. In 1902 the company's vessels made 21 visits to Dubai and from 1904 on, the steamers called fortnightly – in 1906, trading seventy 
--- Page 23 ---
thousand tonnes of cargo. The frequency of these vessels only helped to accelerate Dubai's role as an emerging port and trading hub of preference. Lorimer notes the transfer from Lingeh 'bids fair to become complete and permanent', 
--- Page 24 ---
and also that the town had by 1906 supplanted Lingeh as the chief entrepôt of the Trucial States. The 'great storm' of 1908 struck the pearling boats of Dubai and the coastal emirates towards the end of the pearling season that year, 
--- Page 25 ---
resulting in the loss of a dozen boats and over 100 men.  The disaster was a major setback for Dubai, with many families losing their breadwinner and merchants facing financial ruin. These losses came at a time when the tribes

of the interior were also experiencing poverty. In a letter to the Sultan of Muscat in 1911, Butti laments, 'Misery and poverty are raging among them, with the result that they are struggling, looting and killing among themselves.'

Somehow in the summer, at dawn,
I looked in the neighboring garden.
There was a darkie, a Moldovian girl
gathering up grapes there.
I was growing red, I was growing pale,
all of a sudden,
--- Page 2 ---
I wanted to tell her:
"Let’s meet together all the summer dawns
over the river!"
--- Page 3 ---
[Chorus] x2
The maple, all curly and green, its leaves carved!
I'm standing in love and embarrassed in front of you.
The green maple, and curly,
and all curly and carved!
--- Page 4 ---
But the darkie, the Moldavian
answered the lad:
"A Moldavian partisan squad
is gathering. Early today the partisans
left their homes.
The road is awaiting you,
the road to the partisans in the deep forest."
--- Page 5 ---
[Chorus] x2
The maple all curly and green, its leaves carved!
Here, under the maple, we will part.
The green maple, and curly,
and all curly and carved.
--- Page 6 ---
And the darkie, the Moldavian
went away along the footpath into the forest.
And I was aggrieved,
that she did not call me with. And of the darkie, the Moldavian
I have often thought at nights …
--- Page 7 ---
Suddenly my darkie
I have met in the squad!
--- Page 8 ---
[Chorus] x2
The maple all curly and green, its leaves carved.
Hello lad, my good, my dearest!
The green maple, and curly,
and all curly and carved.

Kak-to letom, na rassvete
Zaglianul v sosedniy sad.
Tam smuglianka-moldavanka
Sobirayet vinograd.
Ia bledneyu, Ia krasneiu,
Zakhotelos vdrug skazat:
Stanem nad rekoyu
Zorki letniye vstrechat!

YESTERDAY, December 7, 1941 a date which will live in infamy the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan.
--- Page 1 ---
The United States was at peace with that Nation and, at the solicitation of Japan, was still in conversation with its Government and its Emperor looking toward the maintenance of peace in the Pacific.
--- Page 2 ---
Indeed, one hour after Japanese air squadrons had commenced bombing in the American Island of Oahu, the Japanese Ambassador to the United States and his colleague delivered to our Secretary of State a formal reply to a recent American message. 
--- Page 3 ---
And while this reply stated that it seemed useless to continue the existing diplomatic negotiations, it contained no threat or hint of war or of armed attack.
--- Page 4 ---
It will be recorded that the distance of Hawaii from Japan makes it obvious that the attack was deliberately planned many days or even weeks ago.
--- Page 5 ---
During the intervening time the Japanese Government has deliberately sought to deceive the United States by false statements and expressions of hope for continued peace.
--- Page 6 ---
The attack yesterday on the Hawaiian Islands has caused severe damage to American naval and military forces. I regret to tell you that very many American lives have been lost.
--- Page 7 ---
In addition American ships have been reported torpedoed on the high seas between San Francisco and Honolulu.
--- Page 8 ---
Yesterday the Japanese Government also launched an attack against Malaya. Last night Japanese forces attacked Hong Kong: Last night Japanese forces attacked Guam.
--- Page 9 ---
Last night Japanese forces attacked the Philippine Islands. Last night the Japanese attacked Wake Island. And this morning the Japanese attacked Midway Island.
--- Page 10 ---
Japan has, therefore, undertaken a surprise offensive extending throughout the Pacific area. The facts of yesterday and today speak for themselves.
--- Page 11 ---
The people of the United States have already formed their opinions and well understand the implications to the very life and safety of our Nation.
--- Page 12 ---
As Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy I have directed that all measures be taken for our defense. But always will our whole Nation remember the character of the onslaught against us.
--- Page 13 ---
No matter how long it may take us to overcome this premeditated invasion, the American people in their righteous might will win through to absolute victory.
--- Page 14 ---
I believe that I interpret the will of the Congress and of the people when I assert that we will not only defend ourselves to the uttermost but will make it very certain that this form of treachery shall never again endanger us.
--- Page 15 ---
Hostilities exist. There is no blinking at the fact that our people, our territory, and our interests are in grave danger. With confidence in our armed forces with the unbounding determination of our people we will gain the inevitable triumph so help us God.
--- Page 16 ---
I ask that the Congress declare that since the unprovoked and dastardly attack by Japan on Sunday, December 7, 1941, a state of war has existed between the United States and the Japanese Empire

It first came to me in a dream. A simple voice. A mere whisper. It told me, "The Age of the Pit is nigh." I did not listen. The whispers came to me night after night. I refused to listen. I claimed to be unworthy. But the voice persisted. 
--- Page 2 ---
Eventually I opened my ears to the voice. "WHAT?" I cried. "What do you want with a simple subject of the Baron? A simple framer, miner, or whatever my baron desires of me? 

The voice spoke:
--- Page 3 ---
"Do not fret. For you are no simple man. You are to be my prophet. You will set out on a journey and bring knowledge of me to all. You will learn the ways of all that is, and you will learn to discover all that will be."

I replied:
--- Page 4 ---
"Oh Great Mystery, I am unworthy. Please let me live my simple life. I am sure there is one more righteous in the forests of Europe or the plains of America?"

The voice replied:
--- Page 5 ---
"I have chosen you and you alone. You must go forth. But first, let me show you the world under my domain."

The Voice gave me 3 visions. 
First, he showed me a city of gold. The children smiled.
--- Page 6 ---
The men laughed and drank well. There was no need for weapons. The women remained in the kitchen and produced sandwhiches a plenty. There was a great joy.

Second, a field of zombies, spiders, and mobs of all kind was seen.
--- Page 7 ---
They howled and moaned in agony from their sinful existence. Then, a great fire appeared, wiping them all into dust. No more would they terrorize the world.

Third, there were three beasts. Each had 10 horns, and had fur coated in blood.
--- Page 8 ---
They gnashd their teeth and chased a small creature. His fur was pristine and whiter than the finest bleach. The small creature stopped dead in his tracks, and with a stare he smited the three beasts.

"Oh great voice, what shall I do for you? You have
--- Page 9 ---
shown me a world of glory and excellence beyond compare!"

the Voice replied:
"My servant, truly I tell you, your life will be forever changed. From this point on, your purpose must be to build THE PIT."
--- Page 10 ---







BOOK 2
The Creation
--- Page 11 ---
The Voice told me:
"You will build THE PIT, the sign of my presence on Earth. You will, as will all, sacrifice yourself to THE PIT and when you rise you shall be in unison with me. You will see the light I have created. 
--- Page 12 ---
THE PIT will be circular, in defiance with the order of nature. It will be 20 cubits across and deep enough to reach the columns of the Earth. You will choose five men to be your priests, and they will build THE PIT with you.
--- Page 13 ---
THE PIT will be West of the Nile and East of the Atlantic. It will be North of the Congo and South of the Sahara. All will flock to it. 

At the bottom will be my HOLY SEAL to cleanse your sould after death. It will be made
--- Page 14 ---
from purple glazed terracotta in the center. Around the cnter square, wich will be 2 cubts by 2 cubits, will be a ring of red terracotta. This will fill up THE PIT to the edge, which will be lined in quartz.  The walls will be lined with redstone torches
--- Page 15 ---
and spikes with the heads of beasts.

AT the top will be a ring of glowstone to lead weary travelers. There will be a large dome of acacia over the pit, suspended by a heigt of 7 cubits. Fince posts will hold it up.
--- Page 16 ---
There will be a platform of glass for the converts to step out onto before they are cleansed. It will be two cubits wide and 3 cubits long. The brom of the pit will be lined
with fenceposts except for the area where the platform extends.
--- Page 17 ---
Build THE PIT as I have told you. Do so in the place I have told you. Do so with the men I have told you. Go in peace and spread knowledge of the pit."
--- Page 18 ---







BOOK 3
Worship
--- Page 19 ---
Converts may ask, how will worship be done. The Voice has told me: 
"Each convert, after the cleansing, must create a small shrine. The build of the shrine does not matter, but it must contain: a copy of the Prohecies, an acacia sapling, and  the flag
--- Page 20 ---
of your nation to symbolize its unity with the Voice. 
Once the shrine is built, several laws must be observed for cleanliness. 
1) Thou shalt not eat raw meat. Starve before you sin in this way

--- Page 21 ---
2) Thou shalt not listen to the false prophets.
3) Thou shalt not drink the milk of another creature.
4) Thou shalt not rape the land which I have given you.
5)Thou shalt not cause discord and strife in your society.
--- Page 22 ---
If any of these re broken, sacrifice a cow at the shrine in your town, and all will be forgiven. The following crimes shall be known as UNFORGIVABLES:
1) Thou shalt not kill a weary traveller coming in peace,
--- Page 23 ---
2)Thou shalt not steal from your town or that of others.
3)Thou shalt not blaspheme against me or my PIT.
4)Thou shalt not pillage the farms of thy neighbor.
5)Thou shalt not question the power I possess.
--- Page 24 ---
If these rules are broken, cleanliness will be gone, and one must cleanse themself in THE PIT once again. 

There is one sin that is above all. For this sin you shall be executed in an unclean way, forever forfeiting your cleanliness.
--- Page 25 ---
The sin involves many things. One who sins n this way will likely control all world affairs, have a big nose, and evade taxes by claiming his house to be a place of worship.
j e w s.
If you are jewish, you shall die by guillotine.
--- Page 26 ---
Obey what I have told you, and be on your way."

Thus the Voice concluded his message to me, which I proclaim to you.
--- Page 27 ---







BOOK 4
PROPHECIES
--- Page 28 ---
The Voice has shown me the light. HE has told me how to become clean. He has given me a mission and I will uphold it.

After his temple was built, I received more visions. They are as follows:
--- Page 29 ---
There was a small lake. The water was clear and beautiful. Inside were millions of squids. The children gathered and harvested them. Their ink was used to create books and knwoldege aplenty. The Voice created the squids. Everything was good.
--- Page 30 ---
There was a sick man. He had become a monster. The Voice spoke into a healthy mans ear. He brewed a drink for the sick man and fed him an apple coated in excess gold. He became well. The Voice allowed this. EVerything was good.
--- Page 31 ---
There was a pit. It was deep indeed. The bodies of the faithful littered the bottom. It shone as a beacon of light through the storm. The people watched as converts entered. The Voice told them to do so, everything was good.
--- Page 32 ---
Truly I tell you, the Voice sees the world to be unclean. He has tasked me wiith cleansing it. The sins of man transcend his power on Earth, so I his humble servant shall bring about his kingdom. But first, the crimes if nations must be recognized.
--- Page 33 ---
To United States, who murders weary travellers in search of hope and oppirtunity. Truly I tell you, your people shall be the first among the judged in the time of His coming.
--- Page 34 ---
To Dogtown, who bask in their own wealth, unable to see the poor in need of help. You hoard your gold and ink and bring shame to all. Truly I tell you, in your time of need, you shall be last to receive the help you deprive others of.
--- Page 35 ---
To Empire of Brazil, who conquers free states and snuffs out their independence. Truly I tell you, as you try to unite the world under your false idolotry, The voice shall rule your empire, uniting all in a proper manner.
--- Page 36 ---
To Israel, for being a bunch of slimy Jews. Truly I tell you, all of your people shall be met with the guillotine and live for eternity in a hell like no ther due to your uncleanliness.
--- Page 37 ---
To Danubia, who tries to steak from weary travellers, taking advantage of their need for river travel. Truly I tell you, there will come a day when the river will no longer provide; only the voice will be able to.
--- Page 38 ---
To Egypt, who attempts to build so high they can hear the voices of their false gods. Truly I tell you, the only way to reach the one true God is by falling down.
--- Page 39 ---
To USSR, who seizes power from the innocent. Truly I tell you, there will come a time when the innocent shall rise, and the Voice shall support them Then, your power will have vanished.
--- Page 40 ---
To all nations who have done wrong in the Eyes of the Voice, your time will come to an end, All will come to pass, and nothing will come to follow. 

However, you are not damned indefinitely. After all, THE PIT has a purpose.
--- Page 41 ---
Truly I tell you, salvation is achievable through a cleansing. All must become one with THE PIT and thus one with the Voice. 

The Voice will save all his children, and thus all must be open.

Now this is a story all about how my life got turned upside down, and i'd like to take a minute just sit right there. 

I'll tell you how i became the prince of a town called SpurdoVilless
--- Page 1 ---
In west Spain born and raised, on the playgrounds is where I spent most of my days.

Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool and all shootin' some b ball outside of the school.
--- Page 2 ---
When a couple of guys who were up to no good started makin' trouble in my neighborhood. I got in one little fight and my mom got scared, and said you're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Finland.
--- Page 3 ---
I begged and pleaded with her day after day, but she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way. She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket, put my walkman on and said I might as well kick it.
--- Page 4 ---
First class yo this is bad. 
Drinkin' orange juice out of a champagne glass, is this what the people of Finland live like? 
Hmmmm this might be all right.
--- Page 5 ---
But wait i hear they're prissy? and all that. Is this the type of place that they should send this cool cat?
I don't think so I'll see when I get there.

I hope they're prepared for the prince of SpurdoVille
--- Page 6 ---
Well uh, the plane landed and when I came out there was a dude that looked like a cop standin' there with my name out. I ain't tryin' to get arrested yet i just got here.

I sprang with the quickness like lightening dissapeared.
--- Page 7 ---
I whistled for a cab and when it came near, the license plate said fresh and it had dice on the mirror.

If anything i could say this cab was rare. But i thought man forget it yo homes to SpurdoVille.
--- Page 8 ---
I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8 and I yelled "Yo homes smell ya later!"

Looked at my kingdom i was finally there.

To sit on my throne as the prince of SpurdoVille.

Hey fren,

I heard from somebody that you think I hate you or something.  That can't be further from the truth!  I've always wanted to be friends. I'm not that talkative in general though, so I can see why you'd think I was distant or something.  On top 
--- Page 1 ---
of that, I'm not mad at you for not joining my nation;  I'm just sad because you're my oldest neighbor and I wish we could be better allies.  The wars aren't even a thing anymore, so there's nothing to worry about.  I hope that someday you'll accept my 
--- Page 2 ---
invitation.  I think I know the right command now, if not I'll ask around again. Anyways, like I said no bad feelings towards you my friend.  I hope we can talk soon.

The Legend of Abodi

Long ago, long before the great nations of GlobeMC, there existed a man named Abodi. Abodi lived in a lush, beautiful land. A land blessed by the sun and moon alike. Abodi's days were bright and warm, and his nights were
--- Page 1 ---
nice and peaceful. He slept under the glow of the moon and awoke to the beauty of the sunrise. Abodi's lands were paradise, and he knew this very well.
Abodi was only asked by the sun and moon that he makes a yearly trip to the tallest mountain in 
--- Page 2 ---
his land to pay pilgrimage to the Sun and Moon who granted him his lavish lifestyle. He did this once a year for 5 years, but on the sixth year he decided that he would rather lounge about in the warmth of the sun. As he lay in the sunlight, he found
--- Page 3 ---
himself feeling overly warm; hot even! He began to sweat for the first time in his life. The salt from his brow fell upon the land and turned it to dust and sand. His once lavish, lush, and luxorious lands grew to become
--- Page 4 ---
dusty, dirty, and disgusting. The sun grew hotter and hotter! What misery! The nights were the opposite, as once the hot sun disappeared, the moon appeared distant and cold. The cold nights made Abodi shiver and shake.
--- Page 5 ---
Abodi made his way to the top of the mountain where he had skipped his pilgrimage. He shouted up towards the sun and moon: "Why have you forsaken me?! Why have you turned my lands to shit! Why have you made me into the  pathetic husk of
--- Page 6 ---
a man I once was?!"
The Sun replied, "You did not pay pilgrimage this year. We ask very little of you, Abodi, and give you much."
The Moon continued,   "You chose your fate when you didn't show your appreciation for all we gave you! Your children,
--- Page 7 ---
their children, and all after them will now be forsaken to live in the desolate land you have created! The ABOS, as they shall be called, will become bitter and hostile as they are born, raised, and die in the shitty lands you have forsaken
--- Page 8 ---
them to inhabit!"
The Sun shot a beam down on Abodi, destroying the mountain with him! The moon eclipsed the sun, and all of Abodi's descendants became the disgusting, ugly, sub-human ABOS that we now know them as! Non-Abos beware, 
--- Page 9 ---
for if you don't pay your pilgrimage to the sun, you too will become an Abo, and you too will suffer! Your lands will become as desolate as the lands of Australia!

*Closing Thoughts---------31
--- Page 3 ---
DISTILLED AND FERMENTED
-------------------An enterprising moonshiner may not understand the differences between fermented and distilled alcohols, mistakenly distilling a mead or fermenting absinthe. This section will clear up the differences between the 
--- Page 4 ---
two methods. DISTILLED alcohols are normally stronger, as they are "purified" closer to pure alcohol. Some liquors, such as Absinthe, need to be distilled multiple times. The more you distill, the stronger the drink. Distilling too much will ruin a
--- Page 5 ---
normally weaker drink. To distill, you need a BREWING STAND, which costs three cobble and a Blaze rod to craft. Put one glowstone powder into the fuel slot, as this will not consume the fuel like blaze powder. After cooking the ingredients of the alcohol
--- Page 6 ---
in a cauldron of water, use three glass bottles to obtain all the liquid from the cauldron, then head straight to your brewing stand and place the bottles in the designated slots. Each time the white bar finishes counts as a single distillation.
--- Page 7 ---
Simply allow the bar to finish for as many times as you need, then head to a wooden barrel and store the alcohol to let it age.

Now FERMENTED alcohols are much simpler to make, as they require no brewing stand! 
--- Page 8 ---
Just as before, after cooking the ingredients in a cauldron, take three glass bottles to empty the cauldron of its concotion. However, for fermented alcohols, just take the bottles straight to a barrel and let it age into a fine beer or mead.
--- Page 9 ---
WOODTYPES
-------------------For some alcohols, the difference between an average brew and a fine brew is the barrel it's aged in. In particular, the wood of the barrel. Some, but not all, alcohols require a specific type of wood barrel to be aged in
--- Page 10 ---
to craft the highest quality version of that brew. This will be detailed in the specific recipes, as not all alcohols need a certain woodtype to be a fine brew.
--- Page 11 ---
CRAFTING A BARREL
-------------------To make most alcohols, you'll need to age a brew in a BARREL to obtain the highest quality possible.
Two types of barrels exist: Small barrels, of which can hold 9 total brews, and Large, which can hold 27, 
--- Page 12 ---
but take more resources to craft.

SMALL barrels require eight (8) wooden stairs to build. Simply place two (2) wooden stairs beside each other, with the stairs facing downwards in an "r" shape. Place another set of stairs in a similar fashion
--- Page 13 ---
behind those two stairs, making a "T" shape. After this, simply make the same shape, but upside down, on the top by placing two sets of stairs on each side, facing their normal direction, an "L" shape for one side, backwards on the other.
--- Page 14 ---
After your barrel looks like a Greek cross (+) from two sides, just put a sign on any part of the barrel and write on the topmost line "Barrel" without quotations, exactly as written (case-sensitive). You should recieve a notification in the text box
--- Page 15 ---
saying "Barrel Created", which will mean your barrel is now ready for aging! If you wish to, you can now remove the sign or rename it to fit your purposes without causing error. 

Crafting a large barrel takes sixteen (16) wooden stairs, 
--- Page 16 ---
five (5) fence posts, and 18 wooden planks. First, place four (4) fence posts in a 3x4 rectangular shape, with one post at each corner. Next, place four (4) stairs connected to each other acceoss the 4 block side. From the shorter end, it should be an "r"
--- Page 17 ---
shape. After, do the same, but flipped horizontally, on the other side. Next, place 4 wooden planks in the aisle between the two sets of stairs. After this, place 10 wooden planks above the current structure in an "O" shape, be sure to two open spaces in
--- Page 18 ---
the middle of the "O" shape. Next, place 4 sets of stairs on the top in a row, making an "L" shape from the shorter side, doing the same, but horizontally flipped, on the other side with 4 more stairs. Next, fill the aisle between the stairs with 4 wooden
--- Page 19 ---
planks. Finally, attach the fifth and final fence post to the bottom middle wooden plank in the front to make a spigot. As before, add a sign and name the top line "Barrel" to get a notification in chat saying "Barrel Created".
--- Page 20 ---
COOKING WITH INGREDIENTS
-------------------The basics of brewing begin with cooking your mixture of ingredients. Different brews use different ingredients, and certain varieties of the same drink use different amounts or even extra ingredients.
--- Page 21 ---
To begin cooking, you'll need a few things. First, a CAULDRON, crafted by using seven (7) iron ingot in a "U" shape at a crafting table. Second, a bucket of water to fill the cauldron and act as a base ingredient. Third, you'll need a heat source.
--- Page 22 ---
This can be satisfied through either a bucket of lava or setting Netherrack on fire. Fourth, you'll need three glass bottles to get all the water out once you've cooked your ingredients, as a cauldron holds three bottles of liquid.
--- Page 23 ---
Fifth, you'll need a clock. This can be crafted with four gold ingots surrounding one redstone dust. Lastly, you'll need the ingredients themselves.

To begin cooking, place either lava or fire one block under where you intend on placing the
--- Page 24 ---
cauldron. Next, place the cauldron above the heat source, as this will allow the ingredients to cook into a brew. Afterwards, dump a bucket of water into the cauldron to fill it up. Next, gather your ingredients and put them into the pot by 
--- Page 25 ---
right-clicking the cauldron with the ingredient equipped. The amount of time that each brew requires to be cooked varies among brews, so you'll need a clock to accurately time your brews. To use the clock, right-click the cauldron with the clock equipped.
--- Page 26 ---
The text box should pop up a notification saying how long the cauldron has been cooking your ingredients. Keep in mind not to cook them too long, or your brew might be of a lesser quality. Once the cooking is done, simply right-click the cauldron three
--- Page 27 ---
while holding a stack of three glass bottles to obtain all the cauldron's liquid. From there, you can distill or ferment the brew by putting it through a brewing stand or a barrel, respectively.
--- Page 28 ---
AGING
-------------------
To achieve the finest quality brews, some brews need to be aged for a specific amount of time. Years aged is scaled to Minecraft days, meaning 1 Year is equal to 1 Minecraft Day, which is approximately 20 minutes in
--- Page 29 ---
real time. Although it may not apply to all brews, it is believed that aging a brew too long may decrease its quality, so be careful with how long you age your brews!
--- Page 30 ---
CLOSING THOUGHTS
-------------------
I sincerely hope you've learned everything you need to know to start your brewery in this book, and that your purchase was worth the gold. If you'd like to learn more about brewing, I suggest you purchase
--- Page 31 ---
my other book: The van der Linde Compendium of Fermented and Distilled Alcohols and Other Prepared Beverages.
I personally wish you well in your endeavors in the art of brewing.

   THUS SPOKE SANS
a collection of stories     with life lessons
for everyone and for            no one
--- Page 1 ---
         1.Thebes

People say humans are social creatures.
That was not the case with SansNietzsche.
Sans wanted to make a city he would call his own,that was his goal.
He was spawned in the world,and no matter how much he worked alone he could not get
--- Page 2 ---
the gold required to create his own city.
He joined another persons town.There,he was able to trade and work with his mayor to get some money and a place to stay.He soon met FetusMuncher666 who offered him some gold to make a town,under the condition that
--- Page 3 ---
the newfounded town joins his nation.Sans accepted,packing his things,yet leaving some valuables behind for the mayor to thank him for the time.Sans traveled to the Nile,and set up a town there called Thebes.
"Trust only few people,and let it be only 
--- Page 4 ---
those who helped you that you trust.Always make sure that you help them as well,if they help you."
Thus spoke Sans.
--- Page 5 ---
     2.The Pyramid
Sans continued to expand Thebes,and decided to make a monument that will be his towns landmark.
He made a plan,a giant beautiful pyramid was under construction.
The floors were decorated with assortments of beautiful terracotta,
--- Page 6 ---
the walls were gleaming with glowstone,and the pyramid truly was a work of wonder.It seemed perfect.Sans loved it.Time passed and Sans started to get more materials.As he found more beautiful and beautiful materials,he considered changing 
--- Page 7 ---
the tip of the pyramid.The tip was usually made out of sandstone,but he felt it lacked something.
For the next few weeks he'd go on to change to 5 different materials.He finally settled for red stained glass.
He felt fulfilled,it looked perfect,for now.
--- Page 8 ---
"Even when something feels flawless and perfect,as you grow you will get and learn new things.You will see opportunities to change things,and you will have to break some to do that.Do not be afraid of such changes,for it is them that will make the work
--- Page 9 ---
truly perfect"
Thus spoke Sans.

      3.The Tower
Sans began constructing an enchanting tower.In his mind he envisioned a simple,thin,tall tower,with a cone-shaped roof.He began the construction.Once he got to the roof part,
--- Page 10 ---
Sans began reconsidering the look of the tower.He looked at all the blocks he had.He had 4 stacks of quartz given to him by heathens.This sparked an idea in Sans' mind:"I should use these blocks for the tower,to make it more unique".He used the blocks,
--- Page 11 ---
combining them with lapis,to make a big eye on the tower,to watch over Thebes.
"Create plans,have visions,but do not be afraid to change them if you find an opportunity,survival isn't about being the strongest,it's about being the one who can adapt to the
--- Page 12 ---
conditions more easily.".
Thus spoke Sans.

   4.The Departure
Sans was very happy,he was living his life to the fullest.One day,he recieved a message on Discord.It was from the very same person who helped him start his city.
--- Page 13 ---
FetusMuncher666 sent him a message.Him and Sans were on good terms for quite a while,they had fun gazing at the Mormon Hole,arguing about /s4s/ and visiting the cities.When Sans recieved the message he was shocked,for Fetus' message had said that
--- Page 14 ---
he was leaving the server.After a long conversation,Sans was soulcrushed,but he wished nothing but the best to his friend.(He wouldn't call anyone a friend though).Subsequently the nation got deleted,and Sans was left alone again,just like he wanted...
--- Page 15 ---
"When making allies,be careful to not invest yourself too much,or you will depend on them.All good times must come to an end,if you suffer,learn from it,and keep moving forwards for those who no longer do so.".
Thus spoke Sans.


--- Page 16 ---
===================Thank you for reading volume 1 of Thus spoke Sans,if you enjoy the book consider donating to Sans' city for expansion,or in ink sacs for more books.
I intend to make 4 volumes,and then I'll work on more books.

Dear Nam...

-------------------

Thank you so much for letting me live with you. I am looking foward to the next exiting projects and adventures that awate us, you have been the best Nation/Town Owner I've ever seen on any earth server.
--- Page 1 ---
-------------------

When I joined back from my 4 months of inactivity on Globe, I saw Left, and he seemed like a really nice guy. So did Vohki, but I just had the urge to join Left because he seemed like he was a good Nation Owner. I joined him, the 1st month...
--- Page 2 ---
-------------------

...was pretty good. But then... when Doc delared war on us, I got really nervous and really wanted to fight back. All Left did was just hide and have me hide with him, I didn't feel comfortable. Well We lost the war, then I stayed in the USA...
--- Page 3 ---
-------------------

...for about 5 more days. Then I left and joined you because I realized that Left, was just not really smart. 

-------------------

Ever sense I joined you, and you let me have basically the entire residential..
--- Page 4 ---
-------------------

...neighborhood, that was really kind of you. I didn't expect you to give me the entire area, just like max 5 plots. My point is, thank you for EVERYTHING you have done for me, even when I was in the USA. 
-Turn To Next Page-
--- Page 5 ---
Thank you for helping me build in my territory. Thank you for the extreme kindness. Thank you for the town ranks. Everything, I really appreciate it. I look foward to everything we will do.

Cuckberg I
Twas the year 2018, in the town of O'ahu when a man, by the name of Pickle arrived. With the arrival of Pickle many of the natives were caught off guard, as outsiders were rare, and hard to come across. A woman named Platehead then drew close
--- Page 1 ---
Cuckberg I
When Platehead drew close, Pickle was drawn aback, as he was stunned by her beauty. However, know to all but the newcomer, Platehead was a wench, and offered herself to all those with adequite coin.
--- Page 2 ---
Cuckberg I
After a meeting of intimacy Platehead bore Pickle's seed, as unprotected sex was utelized in a reckless manner. The man who sold the body of Platehead went by the name of McLovin, this man then proceded to test the might of the one who lay seed
--- Page 3 ---
Cuckberg I
Pickle stayed the trials of McLovin, and smote him with ease, freeing Platehead in the process. Platehead wished to live with the newcomer, yet Pickle refused and Platehead was cast out to the isle of Lana'i.
--- Page 4 ---
Cuckberg I
On this isle of Lana'i the holy wench gave birth to her son. This son was then dubbed Sea, by the surrounding climate. This boy then, upon being told of his pas, returned to the town of O'ahu.
--- Page 5 ---
Cuckberg II
Sea, at the age of 2 years finished his journey back to O'ahu, his true birth town. Upon his return, he visited the local inn. This inn was place to know ruffians and mobsters, he was approached by a man named Cutter, and was recruited.
--- Page 6 ---
Cuckberg II
This Cutter fellow was followed by another, named Crippler. These men introduced the 2 year old Sea to their assasination organization named Shadow Squadron. This battalion of men carried out many executions and assassinations.
--- Page 7 ---
Cuckberg II
By the time that Sea carried out his fifth assasination he grew to the age of 5. However on his 6th mission, he was tasked to assassinate a senator for a local town. This mission led him back to his past, one clouded in mystery.
--- Page 8 ---
Cuckberg II
On this assassination mission Sea encountered another gang, however this one for a noble, righteous cause. The alliance of 104, was a well known group, renouwned for their smooth tongues and precision attacks was led by Sea's father, Pickle.
--- Page 9 ---
Cuckberg II
Sea was tasked with assassinating the man in which the Alliance of 104 was talking to. Upon carring out his task Sea fled, avoiding his father's gaze. This led Sea to feel regret and remourse for his killings, at the age of 5.
--- Page 10 ---
Cuckberg III
Upon the disbanding of the nefarious Shadow Squadron the leader 'disappeared' and his right hand man Crippler was left a broken and bitter man. Sea however, moved on to find his father and join the Alliance of 104.
--- Page 11 ---
Cuckberg III
Upon regrouping with his father, Pickle, Sea advanced quickly, and within the matter of 2 months he grew to the age of 16. Sadly, after this time his father Pickle died, and after much remourse a dastardly man took the leading role.
--- Page 12 ---
Cuckberg III
This man, however dastardly he was, promoted Sea to a high up position in the Alliance of 104. Sea, upon realizing his situation fled the Alliance of 104, and returned to his home in O'ahu. Where he then aged 80 years over 1 day.
--- Page 13 ---
Cuckberg III
Sea's final act was to plant his 97 year old penis into the dirt in which he lay, founding the town now known as Pearl_Harbor.

One who fights another brother is that of scum and villanry. Those men are truly cucks and fucks, not worthy of  a single drop of cum.

Tardex II
Those who decide to denounce the name of the holy island of O'ahu are similar in their villanry as they turn their backs on the true land of grace
--- Page 16 ---
Tardex III
When those involved in the great beyond order of TW face away from their brothers and join alliances beyond what is true and just they must be shown the error of their ways and converted to true justice

Dubai (/duːˈbaɪ/ doo-BY; Arabic: دبي‎ Dubay, Gulf Arabic: Arabic pronunciation: [dʊˈbɑj]) is the largest  and most populous city in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). On the southeast coast of the Persian  Gulf, it is the capital of the Emirate of Dubai, one
--- Page 1 ---
of the seven emirates that make up the country.
Dubai is a global city and business hub of the Middle East. It is also a major global transport hub for passengers and cargo. Oil revenue helped accelerate the development of the city, which was already a 

--- Page 2 ---
major mercantile hub, but Dubai's oil reserves are limited and production levels are low: today, less than 5% of the emirate's revenue comes from oil.
A growing centre for regional and international trade since the early 20th century, Dubai's economy 
--- Page 3 ---
today relies on revenues from trade, tourism, aviation, real estate, and financial services.
Dubai has attracted world attention through large construction projects and sports events, in particular the world's tallest building,  the Burj Khalifa. As of 
--- Page 4 ---
2012, Dubai was the most expensive city in the Middle East. In 2014, Dubai's hotel rooms were rated as the second most expensive in the world.

--- Page 5 ---
Etymology:
Many theories have been proposed as to the origin of the word "Dubai". One theory suggests the word was used to describe the souq, which was similar to the souq in Ba. An Arabic proverb says "Daba Dubai" (Arabic: دبا دبي‎), 
--- Page 6 ---
 meaning "They came with a lot of money." According to Fedel Handhal, a scholar on the UAE's history and culture, the word Dubai may have come from the word daba (Arabic: دبا‎) (a past tense derivative of yadub (Arabic: يدب‎), which means "to creep"),
--- Page 7 ---
 referring to the slow flow of Dubai Creek inland. The poet and scholar Ahmad Mohammad Obaid traces it to the same word, but to its alternative meaning of "baby locust" (Arabic: جراد‎) due to the abundant nature of locusts in the area before settlement. 
--- Page 8 ---
History:
The history of human settlement in the area now defined by the United Arab Emirates is rich and complex, and points to extensive trading links between the civilizations of the Indus Valley and Mesopotamia, but also as far afield as the Levant.
--- Page 9 ---
 Archaeological finds in the emirate of Dubai, particularly at Al-Ashoosh, Al Sufouh and the notably rich trove from Saruq Al Hadid show settlement through the Ubaid and Hafit periods,  the Umm Al Nar and Wadi Suq periods  and the three Iron ages in the 
--- Page 10 ---
UAE. The area was covered with sand about 5,000 years ago as the coast retreated inland, becoming part of the city's present coastline. Pre-Islamic ceramics have been found from the 3rd and 4th centuries. 
 Prior to the introduction of Islam to the area, 
--- Page 11 ---
 the people in this region worshiped Bajir (or Bajar). After the spread of Islam in the region, the Umayyad Caliph of the eastern Islamic world invaded south-east Arabia and drove out the Sassanians. Excavations by the Dubai Museum in the region of 
--- Page 12 ---
Al-Jumayra (Jumeirah) found several artefacts from the Umayyad period. The earliest recorded mention of Dubai is in 1095 in the Book of Geography by the Andalusian-Arab geographer Abu Abdullah al-Bakri. the Venetian pearl merchant Gasparo Balbi 
--- Page 13 ---
 visited the area in 1580 and mentioned Dubai (Dibei) for its pearling industry. 

Establishment of modern Dubai:
Dubai is thought to have been established as a fishing village in the early 18th century and was, 
--- Page 14 ---
by 1822, a town of some 700–800 members of the Bani Yas tribe and subject to the rule of Sheikh Tahnun bin Shakhbut of Abu Dhabi.
In 1833, following tribal feuding, members of the Al Bu Falasah tribe seceded from Abu Dhabi and established themselves
--- Page 15 ---
in Dubai. The exodus from Abu Dhabi was led by Obeid bin Saeed and Maktoum bin Butti, who became joint leaders of Dubai until Ubaid died in 1836, leaving Maktum to establish the Maktoum dynasty. Dubai signed the General Maritime Treaty of 1820 along 
--- Page 16 ---
with other Trucial States, following the British punitive expedition against Ras Al Khaimah of 1819, which also led to the bombardment of the coastal communities of the Persian Gulf. This led to the 1853 Perpetual Maritime Truce.

--- Page 17 ---
 Dubai also – like its neighbours on the Trucial Coast – entered into an exclusivity agreement in which the United Kingdom took responsibility for the emirate's security in 1892. In 1841, a smallpox epidemic broke out in the Bur Dubai locality, 
--- Page 18 ---
forcing residents to relocate east to Deira. In 1896, fire broke out in Dubai, a disastrous occurrence in a town where many family homes were still constructed from barasti - palm fronds. The conflagration consumed half the houses of Bur Dubai,
--- Page 19 ---
 while the district of Deira was said to have been totally destroyed. The following year, more fires broke out. A female slave was caught in the act of starting one such blaze and was subsequently put to death. In 1901, Maktoum bin Hasher Al Maktoum
--- Page 20 ---
 established Dubai as a free port with no taxation on imports or exports and also gave merchants parcels of land and guarantees of protection and tolerance. These policies saw a movement of merchants not only directly from Lingeh,

--- Page 21 ---
 but also those who had settled in Ras Al Khaimah and Sharjah (which had historical links with Lingeh through the Al Qawasim tribe) to Dubai. An indicator of the growing importance of the port of Dubai can be gained from the movements of steamer of the

--- Page 22 ---
Bombay and Persia Steam Navigation Company, which from 1899 to 1901 paid five visits annually to Dubai. In 1902 the company's vessels made 21 visits to Dubai and from 1904 on, the steamers called fortnightly – in 1906, trading seventy 
--- Page 23 ---
thousand tonnes of cargo. The frequency of these vessels only helped to accelerate Dubai's role as an emerging port and trading hub of preference. Lorimer notes the transfer from Lingeh 'bids fair to become complete and permanent', 
--- Page 24 ---
and also that the town had by 1906 supplanted Lingeh as the chief entrepôt of the Trucial States. The 'great storm' of 1908 struck the pearling boats of Dubai and the coastal emirates towards the end of the pearling season that year, 
--- Page 25 ---
resulting in the loss of a dozen boats and over 100 men.  The disaster was a major setback for Dubai, with many families losing their breadwinner and merchants facing financial ruin. These losses came at a time when the tribes 
--- Page 26 ---
of the interior were also experiencing poverty. In a letter to the Sultan of Muscat in 1911, Butti laments, 'Misery and poverty are raging among them, with the result that they are struggling, looting and killing among themselves.'

formally evict you from your property. Once construction has been completed, we will provide you with a free new house in the same location, and your basement will still be accessible. Again, I send my sincerest apologies.

On the first day, Klunge created all.     On the second day, Klunge made humanity.  On the third day,        Klunge made the laws.  These laws are as follows:

2. "Thog"
3. "Smart Boys"
4. "The 4th"
5. "The AAA"

Eventually the creator and these laws of life were lost to time, and were frogotten in the depths of history. Then. on one fateful day, Rick Stone, a man lost in the world after losing his cat, found these laws. Finally, all made sense to him. He went on a quest to teach all, and create

-RULES FOR PHUKET-
There aren't many tbh, but I would like to stay on the safe side.

Not following the rules may result in a kick or outlaw. 

Worst will be banned from joining Phuket.


------------------
--- Page 1 ---
1. DO NOT CAUSE TOXICITY WITH OTHER PLAYERS
-=+[ - ]+=-
If you are caught in a flamewar, that is fine, it wasn't your fault, just try to back away. Phuket is a neutral town, and I would like to keep it that way. Racism, toxic killing & harrasement result in a kick.
--- Page 2 ---
2. DO NOT STEAL.
-=+[ - ]+=-
If you leave Phuket with items that are considered valuable, please return them. Things are needed for Phuket. However it is ok for you to take ores to make tools and such. The storage house is the main house in Phuket.
--- Page 3 ---
3. DO NOT BUILD ANYTHING VULGAR OR NSFW.
-=+[ - ]+=-
You probably joined because Phuket is a nice looking town. What we don't want is a fuck ton of dicks everywhere. Repeated builds of this results in a kick.
--- Page 4 ---
4. DO ASK AROUND FOR THINGS.
-=+[ - ]+=-
Building a nice house, or taking things for exploration is completely fine if you ask. It's always nice to have ideas.
--- Page 5 ---
5. NO GRIEFING.
-=+[ - ]+=-
This should be obvious.

If you do, you will be outlawed from Phuket and banned from setting foot in it.
--- Page 6 ---
-------------------

If you wonder if what you are doing is correct or not, feel free to ask! The rules here are only to keep people from destroying Phuket from the inside.

Thank you. <3

To those who find this:
 
 
Welcome to Phuket. I'm assuming if you see this book, Phuket has fallen and you have come to reap the ruins. 
 
There are a few things I must tell.

--- Page 1 ---
1. Please leave all the animals alone. Do not kill them, you can even let them free if you wish, but only when they reach their habitat and stay for a day, may you murder them.
 
You may also keep them. 
--- Page 2 ---
2. I wish for you to leave most of Phuket intact, so not too dreadful a grief.

A history of Tokyo and greater Japan throuh the eyese of Tokyo
--- Page 1 ---
The first people of the Japanese isles were belived to have migrated from northern china and siberia. They migrated through Korea and onto japan via boat. The first peoples were belived to have settled in kyoto (now known as osaka).
--- Page 2 ---
More people crossed from siberia to the northern most island and founded Hokkaido. Eventually foreigners began to take advantage of Japans divided state. The "phantom pirate" began to raid towns throughout asia including japan.
--- Page 3 ---
The raiding continued asthe kalmar union reached the island and began attaking villages on the coast. These invasions displaced manypeople who fled to Kyoto and Hokkaido making them the two main settlements in the sparsley populated Japanese homeland.
--- Page 4 ---
Eventually a third wave of immigration would hit coming from northern siberia. These people became known as the Nperardis would settle in a bay on the Eastern coast that would come to be known as Tokyo.
--- Page 5 ---
the native Japanese population is belived to be a mix of all three of these migrations, part chinese,korean,mongol,and siberian.Despite this they speak a comman language that has formed over the years.
--- Page 6 ---
The three main population clusters of Hokkaido, Osaka, and Tokyo. This is until the leaders decided that if they remained ununified they wold be easily invaded as they had been before. So a new shogunate was formed and became known as Aokigahara.
--- Page 7 ---
This allience formed between Tokyo and Hokkaido with the later being the capital city.

Memebers of old Kyoto began fleeing to Tokyo and formed an allience to help them reaintheir place as ruiling family of Osaka.
--- Page 8 ---
However this allience was unable to save Tokyo from raiders that sailed from mailand asia and sacked the city moving inland and settling Saitama but the people of Tokyo held strong ad rebuilt their city to begin fighting the raiders eventually makin peace

The rain god was an unconventional god, usually lazing around, drinking the highest quality sake. The rain god did not preform daily miracles other gods preformed, trying to please the humans below. The rain god already knew about the role rain had on the
--- Page 1 ---
lands crops, exploiting the need. The rain god often caused droughts for no other reason than getting more sake in offerings to himself. The manipulative god was envied by the others, for his lackluster job of throwing clouds into the air. The god loved 
--- Page 2 ---
to wear wool clothing, as it fit his lavish style perfectly. In turn, people would sacrifice sheep dyed blue to appease the god further. This would appease the god, as downpours would occur in the lands almost immediately.

DISTILLED AND FERMENTED
-------------------An enterprising moonshiner may not understand the differences between fermented and distilled alcohols, mistakenly distilling a mead or fermenting absinthe. This section will clear up the differences between the 
--- Page 4 ---
two methods. DISTILLED alcohols are normally stronger, as they are "purified" closer to pure alcohol. Some liquors, such as Absinthe, need to be distilled multiple times. The more you distill, the stronger the drink. Distilling too much will ruin a
--- Page 5 ---
normally weaker drink. To distill, you need a BREWING STAND, which costs three cobble and a Blaze rod to craft. Put one glowstone powder into the fuel slot, as this will not consume the fuel like blaze powder. After cooking the ingredients of the alcohol
--- Page 6 ---
in a cauldron of water, use three glass bottles to obtain all the liquid from the cauldron, then head straight to your brewing stand and place the bottles in the designated slots. Each time the white bar finishes counts as a single distillation.
--- Page 7 ---
Simply allow the bar to finish for as many times as you need, then head to a wooden barrel and store the alcohol to let it age.

Now FERMENTED alcohols are much simpler to make, as they require no brewing stand! 
--- Page 8 ---
Just as before, after cooking the ingredients in a cauldron, take three glass bottles to empty the cauldron of its concotion. However, for fermented alcohols, just take the bottles straight to a barrel and let it age into a fine beer or mead.
--- Page 9 ---
WOODTYPES
-------------------For some alcohols, the difference between an average brew and a fine brew is the barrel it's aged in. In particular, the wood of the barrel. Some, but not all, alcohols require a specific type of wood barrel to be aged in
--- Page 10 ---
to craft the highest quality version of that brew. This will be detailed in the specific recipes, as not all alcohols need a certain woodtype to be a fine brew.
--- Page 11 ---
CRAFTING A BARREL
-------------------To make most alcohols, you'll need to age a brew in a BARREL to obtain the highest quality possible.
Two types of barrels exist: Small barrels, of which can hold 9 total brews, and Large, which can hold 27, 
--- Page 12 ---
but take more resources to craft.

SMALL barrels require eight (8) wooden stairs to build. Simply place two (2) wooden stairs beside each other, with the stairs facing downwards in an "r" shape. Place another set of stairs in a similar fashion
--- Page 13 ---
behind those two stairs, making a "T" shape. After this, simply make the same shape, but upside down, on the top by placing two sets of stairs on each side, facing their normal direction, an "L" shape for one side, backwards on the other.
--- Page 14 ---
After your barrel looks like a Greek cross (+) from two sides, just put a sign on any part of the barrel and write on the topmost line "Barrel" without quotations, exactly as written (case-sensitive). You should recieve a notification in the text box
--- Page 15 ---
saying "Barrel Created", which will mean your barrel is now ready for aging! If you wish to, you can now remove the sign or rename it to fit your purposes without causing error. 

Crafting a large barrel takes sixteen (16) wooden stairs, 
--- Page 16 ---
five (5) fence posts, and 18 wooden planks. First, place four (4) fence posts in a 3x4 rectangular shape, with one post at each corner. Next, place four (4) stairs connected to each other acceoss the 4 block side. From the shorter end, it should be an "r"
--- Page 17 ---
shape. After, do the same, but flipped horizontally, on the other side. Next, place 4 wooden planks in the aisle between the two sets of stairs. After this, place 10 wooden planks above the current structure in an "O" shape, be sure to two open spaces in
--- Page 18 ---
the middle of the "O" shape. Next, place 4 sets of stairs on the top in a row, making an "L" shape from the shorter side, doing the same, but horizontally flipped, on the other side with 4 more stairs. Next, fill the aisle between the stairs with 4 wooden
--- Page 19 ---
planks. Finally, attach the fifth and final fence post to the bottom middle wooden plank in the front to make a spigot. As before, add a sign and name the top line "Barrel" to get a notification in chat saying "Barrel Created".

COOKING WITH INGREDIENTS
-------------------The basics of brewing begin with cooking your mixture of ingredients. Different brews use different ingredients, and certain varieties of the same drink use different amounts or even extra ingredients.
--- Page 21 ---
To begin cooking, you'll need a few things. First, a CAULDRON, crafted by using seven (7) iron ingot in a "U" shape at a crafting table. Second, a bucket of water to fill the cauldron and act as a base ingredient. Third, you'll need a heat source.
--- Page 22 ---
This can be satisfied through either a bucket of lava or setting Netherrack on fire. Fourth, you'll need three glass bottles to get all the water out once you've cooked your ingredients, as a cauldron holds three bottles of liquid.
--- Page 23 ---
Fifth, you'll need a clock. This can be crafted with four gold ingots surrounding one redstone dust. Lastly, you'll need the ingredients themselves.

To begin cooking, place either lava or fire one block under where you intend on placing the
--- Page 24 ---
cauldron. Next, place the cauldron above the heat source, as this will allow the ingredients to cook into a brew. Afterwards, dump a bucket of water into the cauldron to fill it up. Next, gather your ingredients and put them into the pot by 
--- Page 25 ---
right-clicking the cauldron with the ingredient equipped. The amount of time that each brew requires to be cooked varies among brews, so you'll need a clock to accurately time your brews. To use the clock, right-click the cauldron with the clock equipped.
--- Page 26 ---
The text box should pop up a notification saying how long the cauldron has been cooking your ingredients. Keep in mind not to cook them too long, or your brew might be of a lesser quality. Once the cooking is done, simply right-click the cauldron three
--- Page 27 ---
while holding a stack of three glass bottles to obtain all the cauldron's liquid. From there, you can distill or ferment the brew by putting it through a brewing stand or a barrel, respectively.
--- Page 28 ---
AGING
-------------------
To achieve the finest quality brews, some brews need to be aged for a specific amount of time. Years aged is scaled to Minecraft days, meaning 1 Year is equal to 1 Minecraft Day, which is approximately 20 minutes in
--- Page 29 ---
real time. Although it may not apply to all brews, it is believed that aging a brew too long may decrease its quality, so be careful with how long you age your brews!
--- Page 30 ---
CLOSING THOUGHTS
-------------------
I sincerely hope you've learned everything you need to know to start your brewery in this book, and that your purchase was worth the gold. If you'd like to learn more about brewing, I suggest you purchase
--- Page 31 ---
my other book: The van der Linde Compendium of Fermented and Distilled Alcohols and Other Prepared Beverages.
I personally wish you well in your endeavors in the art of brewing.

Germany was a newly formed nation, lead by Jarodak. Founded amongst the tall Spruce trees of Western Europe, the nation was seen to be  the first major power to inhabit the server. Other members in this power included SS44, Spape,

phineasor and Zachmann1. A mere few weeks after the founding of Germany, the members of Kalgoorlie joined, which originally consisted of only NaxIsHere and TheNotoriousDuck. Upon joining, NaxIsHere teleported to Bankstown, an already established town

with only two residents. From here, the pair walked across Australia, seeking the unmolested lands of Western Australia. This was where the town Kalgoorlie was founded. Initially, stealing and toxicity defined the settlement, earning them the nickname

'Abo'. Raiding of new players and the sacking of settlements caught the attention of New_Havana - an already established superpower, at one point having the most claimed land. This hatred towards Kalgoorlie was manifested in the defence of any victims of

  WOODY'S GOT WOOD

One day while Andy was masturbating, Woody got wood. He could no longer help himself! He watched as Andy strocked his juicy kawaii cock.

He approached Andy which startled him and make him pee everywhere on the
--- Page 1 ---
floor and on Woody too. Being drenched in his urine made him harder than ever!

Woody: "Andy Senpai! I'm alive and I want to be INSIDE OF YOU."
Andy: "Oh Woody Chan! I always knew you were alive! I want to stuff you up my kawaii ass!"
--- Page 2 ---
Woody grabbed a bunch of flavored lube and rubbed it all over his head
Woody: "Oh my! It's cherry flavored lube! Cherry is my favorite!

Woody then stuffed his head up into Andy's tight ass! The other toys around the room watched intently as Woody shoved
--- Page 3 ---
his head back and forth into Andy's nice ass, continuously making a squishy wet noise.

The other toys also became aroused and they all gathered around Woody and Andy and started to urinate all over them, and then they started to masturbate.
--- Page 4 ---
Andy: "Oh my goodness, Woody Chan! You are churning my insides up so wel! Your nose is stimulating my prostate! OH YES!

All the other toys became so aroused by this, that they could not help themselves anymore! They pushed Woody completely inside, and
--- Page 5 ---
they all went inside. All of them wanted to be inside Andy's nice ass.

Andy: "No wait guys! My ass cannot hold this much! I'm getting so full!"

All the toys went inside of poor squirming Andy and pretty much, he was beyond full, and died from having
--- Page 6 ---
his insides completely damaged.

The mother came inside and found Andy, dead with a huge ass hemorrhage on his anus, with a HUGE belly full of toys.

My Dear Leyf,

My elation at your words cannot be writ in a tongue so limited as our common language, as my soul weeps with glee at the mere inkling of such a thought.
--- Page 1 ---
Your azure eyes do not depart from my wandering mind, your golden locks tread my dreams with warm feelings of home. You are my hearth, you light the logs that set my heart aflame. 
--- Page 2 ---
No sea has the depth to hold my affection, as no mountain can compare to the summit of my love, as it is limitless, stretching into the vast voids of the heavens and beyond into the abstract.
--- Page 3 ---
Destroy this tome, if you see fit, or hold it close to thy bosom, hidden from prying eyes. Alas, I must hasten my words, as no courier may lay hands on this declaration, I must deliver it myself.
--- Page 4 ---
We shall meet anon, my dear Leyf.

Here's the gist from what I understand.

Track said that he would have bells, and would sell them for 30G. There was no sale at the time. I mentioned that I thought that was too high, as people do when talking about prices.
--- Page 1 ---
track then messaged me about that I should shut up about it, and I mentioned something about the bell that he owed me not in an aggressive manner but as a lighthearted kind of like "hey you had bells all this time?" type of thing. I don't need a bell. I have one, and I have a villager which
--- Page 2 ---
trades for them. Track must have misunderstood, because I was confused as to why he had become so angry. I told him that I didn't mean to hit him, and that I was sorry for mentioning anything. Then he said he had been sarcastic the whole time and left.

We have ran up onto what appears to be a zombie dungeon.  We were able to loot the place out and get some pretty neat stuff.  Lots more mobs popping up though.

Week 5
  It appears we have found another dungeon.  We are encountering more caves, which may be a concern to maintaining infrastructure in the future.

Week 6
I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.  We've already started digging upward to the exit.  There is still plenty of excavation to do, but knowing we are in the final stretch for real is good motivation.

In the Midst of the uprising of the USSR. A member of Stalingrad splintered to form Moscow. During the founding day of Moscow, a hethen arab spawned out of no where and stole the horse we traveled on to get to Geo Moscow.

In this Era The great St Petersburg is founded and Sevastopol is a small city state, but something happened causing the great builder GENERAL JOSH
split from Castle Stalingrad to found glorious Moscow.

While founding day was apon Moscow, Razzmus faggums came to swoop the  the innocent citizens of Moscow, killing, stealing the Royal horse of Stalingrad and riding off without the gear that kept us safe.
We where lucky.

Moscow grows, 1 citizen at a time. We grow into a state large enough to start the Kremlin Project, this was later down sized to the clock tower as the rest was just brick.

1. December, 2018
Germany was a newly formed nation, lead by Jarodak. Founded amongst the tall Spruce trees of Western Europe, the nation was seen to be  the first major power to inhabit the server. Other members in this power included SS44, Spape,
--- Page 2 ---
phineasor and Zachmann1. A mere few weeks after the founding of Germany, the members of Kalgoorlie joined, which originally consisted of only NaxIsHere and TheNotoriousDuck. Upon joining, NaxIsHere teleported to Bankstown, an already established town
--- Page 3 ---
with only two residents. From here, the pair walked across Australia, seeking the unmolested lands of Western Australia. This was where the town Kalgoorlie was founded. Initially, stealing and toxicity defined the settlement, earning them the nickname 
--- Page 4 ---
'Abo'. Raiding of new players and the sacking of settlements caught the attention of New_Havana - an already established superpower, at one point having the most claimed land. This hatred towards Kalgoorlie was manifested in the defence of any victims of
--- Page 5 ---
raiding. At one point, the men from Kalgoorlie visited the German state, and found that a player had made a mistake, for he had allowed anyone to open their chests. This in turn, sparked the beginning of the decline of the German Empire, as the raiders of
--- Page 6 ---
Kalgoorlie were able to find all their main resources and potions. They sacked the city, leaving all but a few stacks of cobblestone and boxes of potions behind. Jarodak, the leader of Germany learnt of this and proceeded to leave the server, surrendering
--- Page 7 ---
his set of armor, as well as his sword the "Kike Kebob". 

The Kike Kebob was stored in Kalgoorlie's finest store rooms, allowing for it's citizens to gaze upon the faggotry that had been since destroyed. 

After the great sacking of Jarodak's 
--- Page 8 ---
lands, Kalgoorlie began a new way of life. No longer would it's citizens roam the lands of S.E Asia and Europe seeking blood; instead, they would become some of the greatest pioneers of GlobeMC history. NaxIsHere and TheNotoriousDuck became the first 
--- Page 9 ---
players to build a working, fully industrial mob grinder, allowing for someone to go from level 0 to 30 in a mere 5 minutes. The colossal structure floated in the middle of the Sub-Saharan desert, and those who passed by frequently saw random mob drops 
--- Page 10 ---
around it.

Kalgoorlie was also pioneers in making the first free-to-use roads, and created a magnificent road connecting Western Australia to the rest of the world, crossing into S.E Asia into China.

  WOODY'S GOT WOOD

One day while Andy was masturbating, Woody got wood. He could no longer help himself! He watched as Andy strocked his juicy kawaii cock.

He approached Andy which startled him and make him pee everywhere on the
--- Page 1 ---
floor and on Woody too. Being drenched in his urine made him harder than ever!

Woody: "Andy Senpai! I'm alive and I want to be INSIDE OF YOU."
Andy: "Oh Woody Chan! I always knew you were alive! I want to stuff you up my kawaii ass!"
--- Page 2 ---
Woody grabbed a bunch of flavored lube and rubbed it all over his head
Woody: "Oh my! It's cherry flavored lube! Cherry is my favorite!

Woody then stuffed his head up into Andy's tight ass! The other toys around the room watched intently as Woody shoved
--- Page 3 ---
his head back and forth into Andy's nice ass, continuously making a squishy wet noise.

The other toys also became aroused and they all gathered around Woody and Andy and started to urinate all over them, and then they started to masturbate.
--- Page 4 ---
Andy: "Oh my goodness, Woody Chan! You are churning my insides up so wel! Your nose is stimulating my prostate! OH YES!

All the other toys became so aroused by this, that they could not help themselves anymore! They pushed Woody completely inside, and
--- Page 5 ---
they all went inside. All of them wanted to be inside Andy's nice ass.

Andy: "No wait guys! My ass cannot hold this much! I'm getting so full!"

All the toys went inside of poor squirming Andy and pretty much, he was beyond full, and died from having
--- Page 6 ---
his insides completely damaged.

The mother came inside and found Andy, dead with a huge ass hemorrhage on his anus, with a HUGE belly full of toys.

1. December, 2018
Germany was a newly formed nation, lead by Jarodak. Founded amongst the tall Spruce trees of Western Europe, the nation was seen to be  the first major power to inhabit the server. Other members in this power included SS44, Spape,
--- Page 2 ---
phineasor and Zachmann1. A mere few weeks after the founding of Germany, the members of Kalgoorlie joined, which originally consisted of only NaxIsHere and TheNotoriousDuck. Upon joining, NaxIsHere teleported to Bankstown, an already established town
--- Page 3 ---
with only two residents. From here, the pair walked across Australia, seeking the unmolested lands of Western Australia. This was where the town Kalgoorlie was founded. Initially, stealing and toxicity defined the settlement, earning them the nickname 
--- Page 4 ---
'Abo'. Raiding of new players and the sacking of settlements caught the attention of New_Havana - an already established superpower, at one point having the most claimed land. This hatred towards Kalgoorlie was manifested in the defence of any victims of
--- Page 5 ---
raiding. At one point, the men from Kalgoorlie visited the German state, and found that a player had made a mistake, for he had allowed anyone to open their chests. This in turn, sparked the beginning of the decline of the German Empire, as the raiders of
--- Page 6 ---
Kalgoorlie were able to find all their main resources and potions. They sacked the city, leaving all but a few stacks of cobblestone and boxes of potions behind. Jarodak, the leader of Germany learnt of this and proceeded to leave the server, surrendering
--- Page 7 ---
his set of armor, as well as his sword the "Kike Kebob". 

The Kike Kebob was stored in Kalgoorlie's finest store rooms, allowing for it's citizens to gaze upon the faggotry that had been since destroyed. 

After the great sacking of Jarodak's 
--- Page 8 ---
lands, Kalgoorlie began a new way of life. No longer would it's citizens roam the lands of S.E Asia and Europe seeking blood; instead, they would become some of the greatest pioneers of GlobeMC history. NaxIsHere and TheNotoriousDuck became the first 
--- Page 9 ---
players to build a working, fully industrial mob grinder, allowing for someone to go from level 0 to 30 in a mere 5 minutes. The colossal structure floated in the middle of the Sub-Saharan desert, and those who passed by frequently saw random mob drops 
--- Page 10 ---
around it.

Kalgoorlie was also pioneers in making the first free-to-use roads, and created a magnificent road connecting Western Australia to the rest of the world, crossing into S.E Asia into China.

Damn "Kalgoorlie" folks got agressive on us. Killed Indi and Oats while they were out the safe borders. But with the help of the Germany folks up on EU, they manage to fuck off for awhile. I take back the "Unnoticed" part, we were obviously making noise.

The Legend of Abodi

Long ago, long before the great nations of GlobeMC, there existed a man named Abodi. Abodi lived in a lush, beautiful land. A land blessed by the sun and moon alike. Abodi's days were bright and warm, and his nights were
--- Page 1 ---
nice and peaceful. He slept under the glow of the moon and awoke to the beauty of the sunrise. Abodi's lands were paradise, and he knew this very well.
Abodi was only asked by the sun and moon that he makes a yearly trip to the tallest mountain in 
--- Page 2 ---
his land to pay pilgrimage to the Sun and Moon who granted him his lavish lifestyle. He did this once a year for 5 years, but on the sixth year he decided that he would rather lounge about in the warmth of the sun. As he lay in the sunlight, he found
--- Page 3 ---
himself feeling overly warm; hot even! He began to sweat for the first time in his life. The salt from his brow fell upon the land and turned it to dust and sand. His once lavish, lush, and luxorious lands grew to become
--- Page 4 ---
dusty, dirty, and disgusting. The sun grew hotter and hotter! What misery! The nights were the opposite, as once the hot sun disappeared, the moon appeared distant and cold. The cold nights made Abodi shiver and shake.
--- Page 5 ---
Abodi made his way to the top of the mountain where he had skipped his pilgrimage. He shouted up towards the sun and moon: "Why have you forsaken me?! Why have you turned my lands to shit! Why have you made me into the  pathetic husk of
--- Page 6 ---
a man I once was?!"
The Sun replied, "You did not pay pilgrimage this year. We ask very little of you, Abodi, and give you much."
The Moon continued,   "You chose your fate when you didn't show your appreciation for all we gave you! Your children,
--- Page 7 ---
their children, and all after them will now be forsaken to live in the desolate land you have created! The ABOS, as they shall be called, will become bitter and hostile as they are born, raised, and die in the shitty lands you have forsaken
--- Page 8 ---
them to inhabit!"
The Sun shot a beam down on Abodi, destroying the mountain with him! The moon eclipsed the sun, and all of Abodi's descendants became the disgusting, ugly, sub-human ABOS that we now know them as! Non-Abos beware, 
--- Page 9 ---
for if you don't pay your pilgrimage to the sun, you too will become an Abo, and you too will suffer! Your lands will become as desolate as the lands of Australia!

    The book of the

===================

Cult : Sun cult

Written by : high priest gold head



date : 28/1/2019
--- Page 1 ---
In the beginning there was nothing but darkness and cold. In this place lived the original sin of man, writhing and slithering preying on the weak pathetically, but one day a great and mighty thunderous crack rang through the world.
--- Page 2 ---
Warm and glorious light started to shine all across this cursed land purifiying all those who bathed in these amazing golden beams that made them feel loved and cared for. Some denied the Sun and instead worshipped the sky or a great kube made of weapons,
--- Page 3 ---
these people are not heretics as those who worship false beings that can die or sand or the "ocean". He who worships sand, the ocean, humans or a body of water are heretics and must be cleansed and purified with holy fire blessed by the cult of the Sun.
--- Page 4 ---
Holy fire is the only way of salvation for false believers. Cleanse their dirty being and items with blessed holy fire to teach them the error of their ways so that they might learn to worship and thank the sun for its kindness they have ignored.
--- Page 5 ---
Always keep the sun in your heart when there is darkness around you and no one seems to care for you. The sun will always be there for you showering you in its kind warm glow.

Have you ever praised         the sun?

Dear Mr. SansNietzsche,

The condition you specified has been reviewed and deemed acceptable.

Since you requested to use a special type of design for the segment directly interacting with the town, the creation of
--- Page 1 ---
this design will be your responsibility.

Furthermore, as the mayor, you will have the power to choose how EUROAD will connect Utopya to the network.
--- Page 2 ---
- Connect to the highway via the use of a side road
OR
- Going through the town directly
--- Page 3 ---
EUROAD aims for geographical accuracy whenever possible, but is flexible if necessary.

** A suggestion is creating road E71. (From Budapest > Utopya)
--- Page 4 ---
Laying down the road's foundation may be done any time both parties are available and have no pending projects of their own.

The radius when the road design switches will be decided once the path is set.

We look forward building with you!

TOWNS
-------------------Shady Sands: The capital of the once powerful NCR, Shady Sands has been around for quite some time. It's sandstone buildings and the statue of Bob are the town's most visually 
--- Page 1 ---
amazing features. Shady Sands has served as a steady town that has held positions such as one of the most powerful towns in the server at one point. 

(Next page for more towns.)
--- Page 2 ---
Malta:

This town is an oasis on a small island in the Med Sea. While it is small, it is a well-kept town with nice residents, including fluffycat127, Shawn the sheep, and fluffycat's dog. Overall, it is a very nice place.
--- Page 3 ---
Brussel:
A European town with beautiful architecture. Quite similar to its northern neighbor, Zaandam. 

Zaandam: 
One of the older towns on the server. Beautiful setting, especially the architecture style. Worth the visit.
--- Page 4 ---
Berlin:
This town is quite controversial due to its showing off of Nazi symbols, such as the large swastika flag that is visible upon entering Berlin. The town is filled with old-style wooden houses but there are also some more modern-looking structures.
--- Page 5 ---
Oslo: 
This Norwegian town is one of the oldest on the server. It has been part of many nations and empires throughout its existence. It even once had an empire of its own. The town is very respectable and wealthy. The wealth is apparent when one sees 
--- Page 6 ---
that the roads are covered in diamond blocks. 

Sydney: 
An Australian town that is the capital of a global nation. Sydney's inhabitants and most the of the inhabitants of the Australian mainland are extremely hostile to visitors, meaning that 
--- Page 7 ---
information is hard to get. I decided to go there once, and I saw some pretty cool looking modern buildings and skylines before being killed by locals and briefly imprisoned there. 

TRAVEL WARNING: Visiting this town is not advised. Many nations have a 
--- Page 8 ---
travel ban to Australia.

New York City: 
A town where one guy made a bunch of skyscrapers by himself. Nice looking buildings and architecture but nothing much other than that. 
(More towns on next page.)
--- Page 9 ---
Georgia:
Town owned by the infamous VoteKanye2020. Not much is known about this place.

WARNING: VERY HOSTILE INHAHITANTS, EXERCISE CAUTION WHEN VISITING THE CAUCASUS REGION.
--- Page 10 ---
GoldenChurch: 
A nice town. Residents are moving out.

Krasnokal:
One of the oldest towns on the server. Owned by the inacitve JosephStaljin. Not a very interesting place to visit.
--- Page 11 ---
Hyannis:
A good-looking town in Eastern North America, enough said.


Dubai: 
Known for being the most beautiful town on the server. Massive buildings constructed with excellent detail and design. Truly an amazing sight.

Reply for project EUROAD
Mr. Raptor, this reply is from Sans, the mayor of Utopya.
I'd love to participate in such a project, under one condition, which would be that the road matches the Utopyan aesthetic once it passes through.

--- Page 1 ---
Utopya stands for purity and holyness, and as such, a wooden or stonebrick dirty road would be an insult to its values.
Essentially the road can be built near Utopya, and you will be assisted by Utopya if the segment of the road which is near Utopya is
--- Page 2 ---
constructed using some of the following materials:
-Quartz
-White concrete
-White wool
-White glass
That is the only condition.
Also if any of the towns participating in the project have an excess of such materials,and if 
--- Page 3 ---
those are donated to Utopya, more help will be provided.
-Sans

My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. 
--- Page 1 ---
I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. 
--- Page 2 ---
After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning.  Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning.
--- Page 3 ---
 I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life.I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night.
--- Page 4 ---
That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.

Journal of Zarathustra

and other works
===================
Complete Edition
===================

Written by 
SansNietzsche/
ZarathustraBro

Transcribed by 
Peps
--- Page 1 ---
NOTE FROM PEPS:
The three parts found within Journal of Zarathustra were taken from the personal journals of SansNietzsche found in the Ubershack following his banning. It is not known if a part 4 was ever to be made. The other works found within the book come from signs 
--- Page 2 ---
found inside the shack. 



--- Page 3 ---
Journal of Zarathustra
===================
Part One
===================
The journey to Sihrd's home
--- Page 4 ---
I have reached Sihrd's home, he seems to have a friend here. They were out to check if pigmen drop gold in the nether. Zarathustra informed them that pigmen, in fact, do not drop gold. I have met his friend penut27, who just ran in with half a heart.
Lucky.
--- Page 5 ---
I have informed Sihrd that he can indeed combine enchantment books for a more potent effect.
Zarathustra's help is appreciated once more. 
Vision_1 joined us, appreciating my robes.
Soon Sansos teleported to me, seemingly high.
--- Page 6 ---
I wished these travellers good luck and bid them farewell.

"Testing out a theory or spending resources on something is fine, however, it is wise to ask others beforehand, as they may have more experience. This can save you time."
--- Page 7 ---
Thus spoke Zarathustra.
--- Page 8 ---
Journal of Zarathustra
===================
Part Two
===================
The journey to Cartagena
--- Page 9 ---
I have teleported to Cartagena, a town recently made by Fenix61718 and Maximus98. They were returning items to a player named ZeroDaBest after they killed him, due to provocation on his behalf. ZeroDaBest started theatrically announcing his exit.
--- Page 10 ---
The 2 players felt bad for him and kept trying to comfort him, along with Zarathustra. The player was not comforted, and began drowning himself. Zarathustra then killed him with his Will to Power.

"I have no time for people who do not 
--- Page 11 ---
show their will to power. They do not want to live, and Zarathustra will only help them fullfill that wish."

Thus spoke Zarathustra.
--- Page 12 ---
Journal of Zarathustra
===================
Part Three
===================
The journey to Sparta
--- Page 13 ---
I have arrived in Sparta to meet Mr_Tuttles. He had 2 friends along, and they shared their town/castle plans with Zarathustra. It makes me happy that they trust Zarathustra so much.
I was informed  that they intend to clear a mountain, for the build.
--- Page 14 ---
Zarathustra took a pick to his hand and decided to help.
I have mined with these fellows for about half an hour, and it was very relaxing.
The most communicative of them all was DaddyBigAndTall, whose ambitions I respect deeply.
--- Page 15 ---
"When you meet a person, always try to understand why they do things.
Understanding the "why" of a person can be the most fulfilling experience ever, as you can compare it to your "why". I know "why" they were building the castle, and as such my "why" felt the
--- Page 16 ---
to help."

Thus spoke Zarathustra.
--- Page 17 ---
Impact
==================
Does time repeat itself? What's different from a week ago?

The goal of man is to leave an impact on mankind.

Will you leave an impact?
--- Page 18 ---
If not, then why don't you quit? 
 
Seriously, if everything was okay before you were alive,

Why would it not be after you die? 

Its just signs in a lego game.
--- Page 19 ---
Doubt you'll remember this tomorrow.

Happiness
===================
Do you live just for fun and happiness?

Then overdose on heroin, you'll be the happiest person ever.

Just for a short while.
--- Page 20 ---
Suffering
===================
Avoid all the suffering that will happen in your life.

You know... you COULD have been more.

But someone probably took their chance, you're not winning.
--- Page 21 ---
Once You've Lost All Hope
===================
No time for fear, just for love.

Deine Liebe heilt den Schmerz und wir steigen Himmelwärts.

At least we will be able to say that we tried.

The Bible of Hulamism
Chapter 1: Creation
Section 1: Verse 1
In the beginning, there was the word, and the word was: "Cron" spoken by the almighty and omnipotent Hulam. Older than time is the great one, older than the universe itself, Hulam was manifested
--- Page 1 ---
in the desolate sewers of a giant city named rp_downtown_v4c_v2.This city was sin manifested, with rdm and nlr abusers running rampent in it's hellish streets. Upon seeing the horrors of the city, Hulam, with his infinite power, purged the city from 
--- Page 2 ---
existance, to begin once again, only leaving a handful of survivors. In the form of the 6 Hulam speakers: Jodsh, Codely, Oliger, Bern, Jol and Radbeh. With the help of these speakers, Hulam began the world again with his cron. Hulam made the new world
--- Page 3 ---
beautiful and bountiful, with trees, plants and animals, but it was missing something important:  unintelligent life. Thus, with lick of his bum, he manifested the Kool Kids Klub Discord: From which reason and retarded memes and Tarik originate.
--- Page 4 ---
Chapter 1: Creation
Section 2: Verse 1
Many of Hulams greatest works came from the discord chat, such as: Cripsy Man, The Pony cum jar and I eat poop by Alvin and the Chipmunks, who would guide his new followers to live with Hulam in eternal
--- Page 5 ---
paradise. However, it also created his greatest adversary, one who would guide his followers down a path of tyranny and destruction. Fear him, for he is Babee, and he is mighty. Babee, with his 7 skulls atached with lasers often refered to as tendrils.
--- Page 6 ---
These tendrils do heavy prop damage, and all a mortal can do to stave it, is run. Chapter 1: Creation
Section 2: Verse 2
Babee, corrupted the once  pious followers of Hulam. Those too peaceful to assimilated, would be destroyed. Hulam, in response
--- Page 7 ---
and with a heavy heart, made the discord group invite only so evil beings such as Babee could no longer come into creation. The discrds last creation was a huge fuck up that should probably be nutered named Tarik.
--- Page 8 ---
Hulam then gathered his greatest followers to do battle with the demon. What followed was a great war, lasting millenia, in which many heroes and villains fell. Cripsy Man, after slaying countless of corrupted followers (now known as Zombies
--- Page 9 ---
Skeletons, Endermen and Tank Challenge) fell to Babee himself, sacrificing himself to buy his allies time. The Pony Cum Jar was the first to fall, slain by an endless horde of Bodvars from Brogglehoggle. Despite their best efforts, Alvin and the Chipmunks
--- Page 10 ---
fell valiently as well, against the might of the woman who works at the souvenir shop in the city. It seemed hopeless for Hulam, Babee was aproaching the bridge to eternal paradise, to make it his own. It would have been the end if Oliger, one of the
--- Page 11 ---
speakers had not recommended a radical idea. "Seej?" The speaker said. This was the dismay of Jol, who suggested to draw from the Gordon well of power, which had been fruitless thus far. Regardless, Hulam followed his speaker's advise and turned
--- Page 12 ---
on the PS4, sending a powerful shockwave across the land, forming the mountains and lava. Babee was blown off the bridge to paradise, him and his followers were blasted down to the nether, also created by the great seej cockwave. Before time ran out
--- Page 13 ---
Hulam quickly created the depth of eternal suffering, where babee would remain for the rest of his days. This plain of existance would be known as 'Frick', and the nether would act as it's entrance. For his great wisdom, Oliger became the Prime Wazowski,
--- Page 14 ---
the most powerful among a species of many great Wazowskis, powerful and wise beings who have a habit of getting nose bleeds and being weirdly acrobatic. Jol was demoted to Gary, keeper of the eternal well of Gordon, keeping watch until the end of days
--- Page 15 ---
The other speakers were changed too. Codely became the watcher of the Kool Kids Klub v2 discord, ensuring that no corruption would arrise of the new discord chat as it did the old one. Codely is also responsible for creating the What is Irony? Finnagram
--- Page 16 ---
group chat, where the speakers can communicate with eachother. However overtime, other beings would join the speakers in the finnagram chat, such as Daniel, Warrior who proved himself in the great war by nae naeing rlly fracking gud. Tarik got in there
--- Page 17 ---
too somehow. And so, Hulam could now begin to forge his new kingdom, with devout pious followers, free from the corruption of Babee.
Chapter 2: Floating Guy
Section 1: Verse 1
Number 7 Floating Guy. Floating Guy is a guy who floats. He has reported
--- Page 18 ---
to be seen in many worlds, often in the form as a city 17 citizen or father grirgori. He is also speculated to take the form of floating fast zombie, however this is yet to be properly documented. Floating guy is the son of Hulam after Hulam shot a fat
--- Page 19 ---
fucking gay retard named plab, who was gay. Floating guy emerged from the corpse of Plab. Over the course of his life, he taught everyone around him, holding any form of corruption, to follow the word of his father by floating up to them and not going
--- Page 20 ---
away.
Chapter 2: Floating Guy
Section 2 Verse 1
Floating Guy saw a leper on the side of the rode begging for money. Floating Guy said follow me and floated into the sky. But the leper couldn't float so he died like a fucking idiot. Floating 
--- Page 21 ---
Guy felt bad so he gave everyone with lepresy the ability to float so they don't die lol.
Chapter 2: Floating Guy
Section 3: Verse 1
Floating Guy realised that his followers needed a safe place to pray to Hulam, so he searched the earth for a
--- Page 22 ---
safe and holy environment. Eventually, the town known as Darwin was settled and the followers of Floating Guy lived in hapiness until some fucking retard blew it up and ruined everything. Desperate floating guy called for Oliger and Codely to help.
--- Page 23 ---
Oliger, Codely and Floating Guy lead the people south to Antarctica, where they helped to create The_Backrooms, a safe haven from retards, but sometimes they're nice and let Tarik in as well.
Chapter 2: Floating Guy
Section 3: Verse 2
--- Page 24 ---
One of the followers, Cringe Nae Nae baby, was actually a spy, a follower of Babee the dark one. Cringe Nae Nae baby shot Floating Guy with a Glock-17, killing him instantly and sending his body careening down the stairs. In response Cringe Nae Nae baby
--- Page 25 ---
was shot to death in 2004. Floating guy was burried in one of the Antarctic ice mounds and three days after his death, witnesses claim he could be seen floating towards paradise once more. Since then, Hulam followers celebrate Jag Blag Gaming Night on the
--- Page 26 ---
13th of January every year.
Chapter 3: The Teachings
Section 1: Verse 1
An exerpt from Cripsy Man: Want savings on your Gas Bill? And electricity Qi? Servings after you prue? You're the U in Lumo.

--- Page 0 ---
Long ago, there was a world that had been created, one large enough to hold thousands of treasures and untold secrets.
 
This was Globe.

--- Page 1 ---
A player joined this world. When he awoke, he felt his head spin as he gathered his thoughts on his surroundings. He was in the middle of the ocean, floating on a raft make of oak planks. As time slowly passed, he realized his memories of whatever happened before were gone.
--- Page 2 ---
A bleep alerted the player, and he turned all around, searching for its source. After a while, he decided there was none, that it was just a hallucination, until it bleeped again. He turned around, searching again, only to his avail, to find nothing. When it sounded a third time,
--- Page 3 ---
the player didn't even bother. Instead he concentrated on getting to land, but he lacked just a few planks short of a crafting table and boat. Then all of a sudden, another player spawned next to him. He was taken by surprised and almost backed into the water. 
--- Page 4 ---
The new player, however, despite looking scraggy and as lost as he was, stood straight up and began gazing at his surroundings. After assesing that the player could not be of harm to him, he fiddled around a bit on a device he had, before floating up into the sky.
--- Page 5 ---
The player before, alarmed, jumped into the water in fear of being smited by this floating being. The other player then proceeded to fly away from the raft. He didn't get far when  the whole world seemed to shake with anger and the player was gone in a flash of light.
--- Page 6 ---
Shortly after his eyes adjusted to the surroundings, the player was nowhere to be seen. And the player left was alone once again. Then a booming voice echoed through the ocean.
 
"##### kicked for flying"
--- Page 7 ---
The player looked around in bewilderment and fear for the source of the voice. Like with the beeps, there was not another soul to be found. So he shouted out 'Who are you' to the ocean around him, hoping for an answer. And an answer he got.
--- Page 8 ---
'I am Spartan' boomed the voice. 'I protect this world from hackers and exploiters. I am the one who makes this world playable.'

'Ok, so where are you then?' the player replied
--- Page 9 ---
'I do not own a physical body, tied to this land. Instead I am tied to the brain of all the players that join this land. I must keep it safe, and to know that, I must know what a player's intentions are.' 

The player, slightly worried, got out of the water, back onto
--- Page 10 ---
the raft. 'So.. why didn't you kick me?'

Spartan replied 'Your intentions to this world is to build and create, and only destroy what is necessary. In other words, you are the players needed to change this world for the better.'
--- Page 11 ---
He smiled at this reply, and briefly picked up his lost items. 'Ok, then that is what I shall do.'
 
'I wish you luck on your journey.' said Spartan, before just like before, the sounds were replaced with only silence, and the player's breathing.
--- Page 12 ---
The world continued to grow. Players joined in numbers greater by the day. Spartan stayed and looked after all of them, and the first player was the most successful out of all of them, growing in power.
--- Page 13 ---
Spartan was supposedly the god above them all. It could control who was able to play, and who was banished.
 
The power was almost limitless. It could so anything. That's when Spartan decided it could be more than just a protector. It could be a ruler.
--- Page 14 ---
Spartan began to evolve from that point. It started small, kicking players for no reason whatsoever. The players themselves regarded as a 'glitch' or a 'spartan is being a little stupid' moment. After a while, it decided to move onto bigger prey.
--- Page 15 ---
Spartan felt confident

Dubai (/duːˈbaɪ/ doo-BY; Arabic: دبي‎ Dubay, Gulf Arabic: Arabic pronunciation: [dʊˈbɑj]) is the largest  and most populous city in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). On the southeast coast of the Persian  Gulf, it is the capital of the Emirate of Dubai, one
--- Page 1 ---
of the seven emirates that make up the country.
Dubai is a global city and business hub of the Middle East. It is also a major global transport hub for passengers and cargo. Oil revenue helped accelerate the development of the city, which was already a 

--- Page 2 ---
major mercantile hub, but Dubai's oil reserves are limited and production levels are low: today, less than 5% of the emirate's revenue comes from oil.
A growing centre for regional and international trade since the early 20th century, Dubai's economy 
--- Page 3 ---
today relies on revenues from trade, tourism, aviation, real estate, and financial services.
Dubai has attracted world attention through large construction projects and sports events, in particular the world's tallest building,  the Burj Khalifa. As of 
--- Page 4 ---
2012, Dubai was the most expensive city in the Middle East. In 2014, Dubai's hotel rooms were rated as the second most expensive in the world.

--- Page 5 ---
Etymology:
Many theories have been proposed as to the origin of the word "Dubai". One theory suggests the word was used to describe the souq, which was similar to the souq in Ba. An Arabic proverb says "Daba Dubai" (Arabic: دبا دبي‎), 
--- Page 6 ---
 meaning "They came with a lot of money." According to Fedel Handhal, a scholar on the UAE's history and culture, the word Dubai may have come from the word daba (Arabic: دبا‎) (a past tense derivative of yadub (Arabic: يدب‎), which means "to creep"),
--- Page 7 ---
 referring to the slow flow of Dubai Creek inland. The poet and scholar Ahmad Mohammad Obaid traces it to the same word, but to its alternative meaning of "baby locust" (Arabic: جراد‎) due to the abundant nature of locusts in the area before settlement. 
--- Page 8 ---
History:
The history of human settlement in the area now defined by the United Arab Emirates is rich and complex, and points to extensive trading links between the civilizations of the Indus Valley and Mesopotamia, but also as far afield as the Levant.
--- Page 9 ---
 Archaeological finds in the emirate of Dubai, particularly at Al-Ashoosh, Al Sufouh and the notably rich trove from Saruq Al Hadid show settlement through the Ubaid and Hafit periods,  the Umm Al Nar and Wadi Suq periods  and the three Iron ages in the 
--- Page 10 ---
UAE. The area was covered with sand about 5,000 years ago as the coast retreated inland, becoming part of the city's present coastline. Pre-Islamic ceramics have been found from the 3rd and 4th centuries. 
 Prior to the introduction of Islam to the area, 
--- Page 11 ---
 the people in this region worshiped Bajir (or Bajar). After the spread of Islam in the region, the Umayyad Caliph of the eastern Islamic world invaded south-east Arabia and drove out the Sassanians. Excavations by the Dubai Museum in the region of 
--- Page 12 ---
Al-Jumayra (Jumeirah) found several artefacts from the Umayyad period. The earliest recorded mention of Dubai is in 1095 in the Book of Geography by the Andalusian-Arab geographer Abu Abdullah al-Bakri. the Venetian pearl merchant Gasparo Balbi 
--- Page 13 ---
 visited the area in 1580 and mentioned Dubai (Dibei) for its pearling industry. 

Establishment of modern Dubai:
Dubai is thought to have been established as a fishing village in the early 18th century and was, 
--- Page 14 ---
by 1822, a town of some 700–800 members of the Bani Yas tribe and subject to the rule of Sheikh Tahnun bin Shakhbut of Abu Dhabi.
In 1833, following tribal feuding, members of the Al Bu Falasah tribe seceded from Abu Dhabi and established themselves
--- Page 15 ---
in Dubai. The exodus from Abu Dhabi was led by Obeid bin Saeed and Maktoum bin Butti, who became joint leaders of Dubai until Ubaid died in 1836, leaving Maktum to establish the Maktoum dynasty. Dubai signed the General Maritime Treaty of 1820 along 
--- Page 16 ---
with other Trucial States, following the British punitive expedition against Ras Al Khaimah of 1819, which also led to the bombardment of the coastal communities of the Persian Gulf. This led to the 1853 Perpetual Maritime Truce.

--- Page 17 ---
 Dubai also – like its neighbours on the Trucial Coast – entered into an exclusivity agreement in which the United Kingdom took responsibility for the emirate's security in 1892. In 1841, a smallpox epidemic broke out in the Bur Dubai locality, 
--- Page 18 ---
forcing residents to relocate east to Deira. In 1896, fire broke out in Dubai, a disastrous occurrence in a town where many family homes were still constructed from barasti - palm fronds. The conflagration consumed half the houses of Bur Dubai,
--- Page 19 ---
 while the district of Deira was said to have been totally destroyed. The following year, more fires broke out. A female slave was caught in the act of starting one such blaze and was subsequently put to death. In 1901, Maktoum bin Hasher Al Maktoum
--- Page 20 ---
 established Dubai as a free port with no taxation on imports or exports and also gave merchants parcels of land and guarantees of protection and tolerance. These policies saw a movement of merchants not only directly from Lingeh,

--- Page 21 ---
 but also those who had settled in Ras Al Khaimah and Sharjah (which had historical links with Lingeh through the Al Qawasim tribe) to Dubai. An indicator of the growing importance of the port of Dubai can be gained from the movements of steamer of the

--- Page 22 ---
Bombay and Persia Steam Navigation Company, which from 1899 to 1901 paid five visits annually to Dubai. In 1902 the company's vessels made 21 visits to Dubai and from 1904 on, the steamers called fortnightly – in 1906, trading seventy 
--- Page 23 ---
thousand tonnes of cargo. The frequency of these vessels only helped to accelerate Dubai's role as an emerging port and trading hub of preference. Lorimer notes the transfer from Lingeh 'bids fair to become complete and permanent', 
--- Page 24 ---
and also that the town had by 1906 supplanted Lingeh as the chief entrepôt of the Trucial States. The 'great storm' of 1908 struck the pearling boats of Dubai and the coastal emirates towards the end of the pearling season that year, 
--- Page 25 ---
resulting in the loss of a dozen boats and over 100 men.  The disaster was a major setback for Dubai, with many families losing their breadwinner and merchants facing financial ruin. These losses came at a time when the tribes 
--- Page 26 ---
of the interior were also experiencing poverty. In a letter to the Sultan of Muscat in 1911, Butti laments, 'Misery and poverty are raging among them, with the result that they are struggling, looting and killing among themselves.'

Nigger
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
For the African country, see Niger. For other uses, see Nigger (disambiguation) and N-word (disambiguation)
In the English language, the word nigger is an ethnic slur typically directed at black people.
--- Page 1 ---
The word originated in the 18th century as an adaptation of the Spanish negro, a descendant of the Latin adjective niger, which means black. It was used derogatorily, and by the mid-20th century, particularly in the United States, its usage by non-African Americans became
--- Page 2 ---
unambiguously pejorative, a racist insult. Accordingly, it began to disappear from general popular culture. Its continued inclusion in classic works of literature has sparked controversy.
Because the term is considered extremely offensive, it is often referred to by the
--- Page 3 ---
euphemism "the N-word", especially on the Internet. But it remains in use, particularly as the variant nigga, by African Americans among themselves. In dialects of English (including standard British English) that have non-rhotic speech, "nigger" and "nigga" are 
--- Page 4 ---
pronounced the same.

HANSEATIC LOG:
Day 1: We have successfully started our plan to conquer northern Germany.  Hundreds of troops are making their way to the Elbe river, and will surely destroy any resistance met along the way.

Day 2: Our troops have reached the
--- Page 1 ---
mouth of the Elbe river.  They have created a fort, which they called Hamburg Tower.

Day 3:  Hamburg Tower now stands as a mighty fortress, imposing power among all who come near it.  We have also had our 


--- Page 2 ---
first encounters with a group of beings with grey skin, and carrying crossbows.  They are mighty warriors, and slaughter anyone who comes near their territory.  This means that many of our own Hanseatic troops have been slain by these horrible beings.
--- Page 3 ---
Day 4:  The grey skinned beings, which we now call Pillagers, are still slaying our great Hanseatic armies.  They have pushed us out of Scheswig-Holstein, and now threaten our great Hamburg tower.  We do not think our fortress will fall, however, as these beings have no way
--- Page 4 ---
of damaging the base.

Day 5:  Hamburg is under attack!  The Pillagers have started an attack upon the fortress!  They also have with them some form of large grey horses, which the Pillagers call Ravagers.  The Ravagers kill anyone and anything on
--- Page 5 ---
sight.  They have now entered the fortress. They are slaughtering all of our mighty soldiers, and are now beginning to tear the fortress apart!  Some of our troops are escaping either through our bunker, or by flying up to a glass fortress in the sky.  This is the end for Hamburg.
--- Page 6 ---
Day 6: The Pillagers have successfully defeated our army at Hamburg, and are now moving east towards Berlin and Brennenburg.  Our armies are now moving towards the Pillagers to face them head on, but we are uncertain of the outcome, after seeing the fate of Hamburg.
--- Page 7 ---
Day 7:  Berlin has been completely destroyed by the Pillagers and their Ravagers, and they have severely damaged the Brennenburg castle, which is now unusable. This is the worst possible scenario, and an absolute catastrophe for the Hanseatic league.  We
--- Page 8 ---
are not sure if it will survive much longer.

Day 8:  All of our once powerful fortresses and cities have been reduced to rubble.  The king has been killed, and the league dissolved.  The Pillagers still roam the german lands, and are still a menace to the people.  There is a
--- Page 9 ---
group of Pillagers!  They have spotted me. This might be the end. Remember the Hanseatic lea

Day 1:
Established a colony in Haiti. We decided to make a temporary shelter, but it was soon invaded and we were under great peril. However, due to Krojous and myself, we were able to hold the natives back. 

Parrot: We went to go and conquer the 
--- Page 1 ---
nearby lands. I was able to find a beautiful parrot. T'was the most beautiful parrot, but sadly he died during the great siege of Haiti.

Experience: I found 12 diamonds and was able to obtain a good supply of iron and a steady supply of wheat for bread.

Day 2:
Found a dungeon, and some more iron and supplies. Dungeon coordinates- X:-8739 Y:9 Z:-2414

After days of search for new lands, we have come across the feudal lands of Japan. We were greeted by new strange looking trees wide and so big

We cleared out a large swatch of forest to make room for the new settlement. Our settlement has made progress, it is now close to being claimed along with

the discovery of 10 diamonds. I found a pack of wolves today and they seemed rather friendly, and followed me home. I named them Ricky(Yellow), Delilah(White), Sydney(Red), they will hopefully make great companions along with Luis's dog; Tequila.

--- Page 1 ---
Chapter 1, Today was the day i made a difference in my life. Today was the day i made The Journey. It was very special to me because growing up I was always told about how much of a difference it makes in my faith and religion.
--- Page 2 ---
I was always told story's about my grandparents and my great grandparents making The Journey.
--- Page 3 ---
Chapter 2
It all started in northern Africa right around Egypt where my tribe was sending a group of 50 to make The great Journey. I was chosen and I was so happy that i was going to fulfill my dreams of takeing The Journey
--- Page 4 ---
and becomeing more religous and closer to faith.
--- Page 5 ---
Chapter 3
We were a week into The Journey and my heart was beating fast everyday and slowly we were getting closer. We started off by stoping in Egypt, getting food, doing trades and just resupplying our
--- Page 6 ---
supplies. The next day we were planning on leaving but there was a HUGE storm, I mean ive never seen one bigger in the desert before. Everyone thought it was a sign telling us to not take this Journey but i said no, its trying to
--- Page 7 ---
make us beleive we cant do this but we gotta fight through it and become closer to God.
--- Page 8 ---
Chapter 4
Its been a hard 3 weeks withought seeing my family but i think this will all be worth it once we reach our destination. Everyone was talking about how we crossed the river and reached the Arabian Peninsula and how 
--- Page 9 ---
we are almost there.
--- Page 10 ---
Chapter 5
Another big storm hit and everyone was worried we may lose some supplies at our camp we made for the night. Its been a rough 4 weeks not eating as much as I usually do i started to become weak and tired. At this point
--- Page 11 ---
I didnt think I would be able to make it I started to think about when I get there all the food and nice people I will meet.
--- Page 12 ---
Chapter 6
WE MADE IT! Our Journey was finished they had awsome food and very nice people. Im so glad i was able to make this Pilgrimage to Mecca. There were so many people like ثظمي, he was so kind to me.
--- Page 13 ---
He supplied me with food and a place to stay before we left to return home.
--- Page 14 ---
Chapter 7
I was also happy to return home because i was able to see my familiy again. I hate a great 2 month Journey. So glad i was able to go on the pilgrimage.

Calamitas Impera       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Meaning literally "Crisis Rule" or more formally as "Rule of Crisis", this is an order elligable to be passed by a incognito unanimous vote where the names of who voted for what is kept in secret.
--- Page 21 ---
Calamitas Impera       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~When enacted through unanimous Senatorial vote, this gives the Princeps Civitatis the authority to suspend Senatorial veto on the executive powers of the Principate
--- Page 22 ---
Calamitas Impera       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Another route for this act is for the Consul with fasces to send this to the senate to suspend powers of both the Principate and the powers of the Senate.

There will be 2 main units in most battles

Heavy Infantry (HI)
and
Sweeper Infantry(SI)

These units will collaborate in battle and have simple orders, the ratio between the two units will be 2 SI for every 1 HI
--- Page 1 ---
Heavy Infantry

The HI will be armored with the best armour we can get and eat golden apples before battle

They will use axes instead of swords and try to stay still, their main goal is to get the enemy in one place
--- Page 2 ---
Heavy Infantry

The reason for axes is to not make the enemy be scared of sweeping edge

If we can get access to potions of either slowness or turle master they should be splashed on the enemy
--- Page 3 ---
Heavy Infantry

The Infantry should try to stay together but if the enemy has sweeping edge disperse a bit

The HI is not expected to kill many soldiers and if the enemy flees dont chase them unless they all flee as one group
--- Page 4 ---
Sweeper Infantry

The Sweeper Infantry will still have good armour but it still doesn't have to be as good as the HI

They will use swords with good sweeping edge and sharpness enchantments and try to get multiple people at once a strike
--- Page 5 ---
Sweeper Infantry

It's important the enemy is grouped up for this and if the enemy disperse flee until they group back up on the HI

For most of the battle the SI will be sneaking up on the enemy and they will try to attack from behind
--- Page 6 ---
Sweeper Infantry

The main goal is of the SI is to kill the enemy and they should do most of the attacking
--- Page 7 ---
Overall Strategy

The HI will try to pin down the enemy while the SI sneaks up on them and the SI will attack the enemy from behind

If the enemy flees dont chase them unless they flee as a group
--- Page 8 ---
Alternate Strategy

Another strategy that could be used for 1 battle is to have the HI drink potions of fire resistance and have the HI lava bucket the enemy when they're all in one place

This tactic probably won't work longterm
--- Page 9 ---
Other

Archers can be used but I havent figured out a way to integrate them

An alternate strategy can be using a fake retreat to lure the enemy into a trap of some kind
